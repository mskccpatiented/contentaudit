The information in this booklet will help you protect your right to make your own decisions about your healthcare. It contains information about:

* How to choose someone to make healthcare decisions for you if you can't.
* How to talk with your loved ones about what you would want if ever you're unable to speak for yourself.
* How document your choices in a way that is recognized by the law. 

This process is called advance care planning. Advance care planning allows you to think about important issues when you're healthy and don't need to make decisions right away. By planning your care when you aren't under too much emotional stress, you make sure your wishes are carried out the way you would want them to be. Planning in advance helps put your loves ones at ease because they don't have to guess what you would want and worry whether they've made the right decision. 

It can be hard to think about what kind of care you would want if you become very sick or as you near the end of your life. We've designed this booklet to help you think about what you would want and to help you talk to your loved ones about it. As you follow along with this booklet, you may want to use the spaces provided to write in notes and questions. 

### Choose Your Health Care Agent
Your healthcare agent (also called a proxy, surrogate, or representative) is someone you choose to make health care decisions for you only if you cant make them for yourself. If you can communicate and are able to understand your treatment options, your health care team will work with you to make your own decisions about your treatment.  Your health care agent is involved in medical decisions only and does not have legal authority to make decisions about your finances or anything else.

Choose someone who can legally serve as your healthcare agent. A friend, family member, or anyone you trust can be your health care agent, as long as he or she is at least 18 years of age and is not your doctor or any other member of your health care team. Also, it is important you choose someone who

* Is willing to talk with you about your wishes regarding medical care 
* You trust to follow through with your choices
* Understands your religious and ethical beliefs
* Will be available in the future
* Understands the role of a health care agent and is willing to serve as one
* Is able to communicate well with others
* Can make difficult decisions 

Many people choose their spouse, partner, or other family member. However, not everyone will feel comfortable taking on this responsibility. No matter who you choose, its important to talk openly and honestly with the person before making a decision. 

You can choose more than one healthcare agent. That way, if your healthcare agent is not available in an emergency, your doctor will call the second person. 

When you have someone in mind, review the information in the next section together.

### Talk About Your Beliefs and Goals
These conversations can be difficult, so we've included the questions below to get you and your healthcare agent started. When talking about these situations, talk about not only what you would want, but why. This will give your health care agent a better understanding of your wishes. Its also helpful to talk with your healthcare providers, other friends and family, and other people you trust, such as a spiritual advisor or lawyer. Remember, these advance care planning is process, not something that gets done all at once.

You don't have to spell out specific medical treatments that you want or don't want. In fact, that is usually a bad idea to try to do, unless you are facing a situation now in which you need to decide about a specific plan of care. Even though the distant future is unpredictable for most of us, who we are as a person remains pretty much the same.

* Are there certain situations in which you would not want a lot of medical treatment?
* How much are you willing to go through to extend your life?

Palliative care focuses on the relief of pain and other symptoms, both physical and emotional. It can be provided at any point during a persons illness, even at the same time as other treatments. Palliative care is not the same as hospice care, which is explained below. What are you feelings about palliative care?




Hospice care is palliative care at the end of life, when a persons life expectancy is 6 months or less. The goal of hospice care is to provide comfort and support while stopping any treatments intended to cure a disease. The care can take place at home or in a hospital. Would you be interested in hospice care at the end of your life?

* What are some things that would make the end of your life most peaceful?
* What are your biggest concerns and/or fears about the end of your life?





How important is it for you to be independent at the end of your life? 





Its helpful to talk with your healthcare agent about specific treatments that you may or may not want to receive and the circumstances when you would or would not want to receive them. Here are some examples:

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can be done if your heart stops beating and/or you stop breathing. Forceful pressure on your chest (compressions) and electric shocks (defibrillation) can be used to try to restart your heart. Mouth to mouth breathing and/or a breathing tube can be put in your airway (intubation) and a machine can be used to breathe for you. Write your questions and thoughts about whether you would want CPR.




Intubation and mechanical ventilation can be done if you stop breathing while your heart is still beating. Intubation is the process of inserting a tube into your mouth and then into your airway. This is done so that you can be placed on a mechanical ventilator, which is also called a breathing machine. The mechanical ventilator sends oxygen into your lungs to either help you breathe or breathe for you. Write your questions and thoughts about whether you would want to be placed on a breathing machine. 




Artificial hydration and nutrition adds to or replaces normal eating and drinking. A feeding tube can be placed directly into the stomach or into the nose and down into the stomach to give you food and liquids. You can also receive nutrition through a vein. Artificial hydration and nutrition can be used temporarily if youre unable to eat or drink enough while receiving treatment that might help you recover. It can also be used to keep your body alive if you were unconscious and there was very little chance you would become conscious again. Write your questions and thoughts about whether you would want to receive artifical hydration and/or nutrition, and in what situations.

Document Your Choices

Once you have chosen your healthcare agent and he or she has agreed, youll need to put it in writing.  You can do this by completing a healthcare proxy form. Forms are available from your healthcare provider at MSKCC, a Patient Representative, or on the websites listed at the end of this booklet. 

In New York, a health care proxy form becomes valid once you sign and date it in front of 2 witnesses. Anyone who is 18 years of age or older can be your witness; however, your healthcare proxy cannot be your witness. Your witness will also need to sign the form. You do not need a lawyer or a notary to complete this form.  

Give a copy of your completed healthcare proxy form to all your healthcare providers, your healthcare agent, and your lawyer if you have one. You should also keep a copy for yourself. Tell your other loved ones who youve appointed as your healthcare agent and ask them to be supportive of that person.

With advance care planning, your loved ones will be better able to carry out your wishes in the event that youre not able to speak for yourself. Choosing and documenting your healthcare agent and talking with him or her, your healthcare providers and other loved ones is just the beginning, but once youve started it will be easier to talk about changes or related issues in the future. Your wishes may change over time, so its a good idea to have conversations about your plan every time your treatment goals change.
