PURPOSE
Stem cells are blood cells that have not matured. When stem cells mature, they become a specific kind of blood cell, such as a red blood cell or a platelet. They are also known as pluripotent or progenitor stem cells. Peripheral blood is blood that is found in blood vessels. It has every kind of blood cell. Stem cells are also found in the bone marrow. Peripheral stem cell harvesting is the procedure used to collect some of the stem cells in your blood. When stem cells are taken from a donor, it is called allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell harvesting. 

Chemotherapy and radiation destroy patients stem cells. The stem cells that you donate will be given to the patient. This is called a peripheral blood stem cell transplant. The donated cells will grow, mature, and replace the patients destroyed cells.

PREPARATION
Before the harvesting is done, you will receive a medicine called G-CSF. It helps move the stem cells from the bone marrow where they are made, into the circulating blood. When stem cells are in the circulating blood they can be collected. You will get this medicine by injection under the skin twice a day for about five to six days. You will either be taught to do the injections yourself or you can discuss other arrangements for these injections with your nurse..  

Common side effects of G-CSF include bone pain in the arms, legs, and lower back. It can also cause headaches and flu-like symptoms. Either regular or extra strength acetaminophen (Tylenol) may relieve these side effects. If acetaminophen (Tylenol)  does not help, the doctor will prescribe something stronger. At the end of this booklet is a chart listing the dates for getting the G-CSF and having your stem cells harvested. If you will be giving yourself the G-CSF, you must store it in the refrigerator. 

HARVESTING
The harvesting procedure takes place in the Donor Room. It is located at 1250 First Avenue (between 67th and 68th Streets). You will have two appointments on consecutive days. On these days, you will get the dose of G-CSF at least one hour before your appointment. The harvesting is done while you are on a bed or in a recliner chair. It usually takes 3-4 hours. A needle will be inserted into a vein in each arm. A machine that separates the stem cells from your blood will be connected to the needle in one arm. The blood goes through the machine to collect the stem cells. The rest of the blood returns to you through the needle in your other arm.  

As the stem cells are collected some donors have:
* Muscle cramps 
* Twitching 
* A tingling sensation around their lips and on their fingertips  
These are signs of a low calcium level in the blood. To help reduce these effects, on the night before and the morning of your stem cell harvest dates you should:
* Drink milk 
* Eat cottage cheese and other dairy foods  
The Donor Room staff can also give you Tums tablets. These are a quick and easy source of calcium.

AFTER THE PROCEDURE
* Dressings will be applied where the needles were inserted into your arms.  
* Keep the dressings in place for three hours.  
* If there is bleeding when you remove the dressings, apply gentle but firm pressure on the sites. Do this for three to five minutes. Call your doctor if the bleeding does not stop.
* Most donors can go back to their regular activities the day of or the day after the donation.

CALL YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU:
* Develop a fever of 100.5 F (38 C) or higher.
* Have any of the following where the needles were inserted in your arms:
-Redness 
-Bleeding 
-Pain 
-Swelling 
* Have any questions or concerns.
