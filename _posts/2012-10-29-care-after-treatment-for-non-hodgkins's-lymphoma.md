Now that you have completed treatment, you will enter our follow-up program. Follow-up visits are an important part of your care.. If your cancer should come back, finding out early will help your doctors decide how to move forward.

It is important that you have regular exams by a doctor or nurse practitioner.  Our standard follow-up schedule is below, but your doctor may  change it based on your  individual needs.  This fact card will help you plan for your long-term follow-up after treatment.  It also tells you when you will need  tests.

If you have any questions about this information, please contact your doctor or nurse.

*Imaging:  
* This is most often a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. 
* If you had Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma involving the chest, a chest x-ray may be done on the visits when a CT is not done.  
* A PET scan may be recommended to follow your status.

**Health Maintenance:  
* Mammogram
? Women over the age of 40 should have one done each year.
? Women under the age of 40 who had radiation to the chest or armpit should begin these earlier. Start at whichever time comes first:
* 7 years after completing radiation
* At age 40
* Annual lipid profile
? This is a blood test that tells you your cholesterol and triglyceride (a type of fat) levels. The need is based on the drugs or radiation therapy you received.
? Your doctor or nurse will tell you if you need to have this done each year. 

Important Things You Should Know
* Our follow-up care for you will focus on your cancer history and treatment. If you do not have an internist or family practitioner, please contact one. He or she will focus on your general health. We will work closely with each other. 
* Please review the MSKCC Guidelines for Cancer Screening.  These guidelines are an important part of your long-term care.  Discuss them with your internist.  
* We recommend that you have:
? The flu vaccine every year. 
? The pneumonia vaccine every 5 years.
* Ask your internist to discuss general health issues with you. These include cholesterol, diet, blood pressure, exercise, smoking, and alcohol. 
* Our  Resources for Life After Cancer program offers social support, education, and counseling. You can find a listing of their services, including a group specifically for lymphoma,  online at http://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/survivor/resources-life-after
