This information will teach you about the placement and care of your central venous catheter (CVC). A CVC is placed in a large vein near the collarbone (see Figure 1). There are many different types of catheters and your doctor will decide which kind is best for you. All devices have 1 central catheter that enters your body. On the outside, the catheter may divide into 2 or 3 lumens. Each lumen has a clamp and a cap on the end.
A CVC can be used to give * Fluids
* Chemotherapy
* Medicine
* Blood transfusions
* Intravenous (IV) nutrition
The advantages of having a catheter are
* You wont need as many needle sticks.
* It can stay in your body as long as a few years and be removed when it is no longer needed.
A nurse will help you learn how to care for your catheter. You can have a caregiver, family member, or friend learn with you. You will learn how to change your dressing and catheter caps. You will also learn how to flush your catheter using a syringe with heparin. This must be done to keep clots from forming inside your catheter. After you go home, use this information to help you remember the steps to care for your catheter.
Before Your Procedure
Please follow the instructions below to prepare for the placement of your CVC.
  Dont take aspirin, any products that contain aspirin, or vitamin E for 5 days before your procedure. Review the card Common Medicines Containing Aspirin and Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs). It tells you which products have aspirin and which are anti-inflammatory medications.
  Ask your doctor what to do if you take  Blood thinners such as
* Warfarin (Coumadin&reg;) * Cilostazol (Pletal&reg;)
* Dalteparin (Fragmin&reg;)
Figure 1: Central venous catheter



* Enoxaparin (Lovenox&reg;)
* Heparin injected under the skin (subcutaneously) 
* Clopidogrel (Plavix&reg;)
* Prasugrel (Effient&reg;)
 Medication for diabetes such as insulin
  Call your doctor before your procedure if you develop any illness. This includes a fever, cold, flu, or sore throat.
  If you have been told to be on a clear liquid diet
 Dont eat any solid food after midnight the night before your procedure.
 Continue to drink clear liquids up to 2 hours before you arrive at the hospital for your procedure.
Day of Your Procedure
You must have a responsible adult go home with you after your procedure. We recommend that this person drive you home or take you home in a taxi.
On the day of your procedure, please be aware that many things can affect the start time of your procedure. The procedure before yours may last longer than expected. An emergency procedure may need to be done in the room you are scheduled to be in. If there is a delay in your start time, we will let you know.
The morning of your procedure
  You may shower, but dont apply any cream or lotion.
  Take all medications you normally take (except those listed above).
  Ask your doctor or nurse if you have questions about what medications you should take.
  Bring the following to the hospital:
 Your medications
 Only the money you will need (e.g., for a newspaper or parking costs)
  If you wear contact lenses, wear glasses instead. If you dont have glasses, bring a container for your contact lenses.
  Leave valuables and jewelry, including rings, at home.
Enter the hospital through the main entrance at 1275 York Avenue. Take the M elevators at the top of the escalator to the 2nd floor. As you step off the elevator, enter the double doors to the Surgical Day Hospital (SDH). Check in at the desk. Please arrive on time.
In the SDH, you will change into a gown, robe, and slippers. When you are ready, you will be taken to Interventional Radiology.



Procedure
An IV line will be started. You will receive medication through the IV line to control pain and anxiety. Your blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and oxygen levels will be monitored during your procedure.
Two areas of your body will be numbed with a local anesthetic. A small incision (surgical cut) will be made near your collarbone, usually at the base of your neck. This incision will be used to gain access to the vein where the catheter will be placed. A second incision will be made on your chest, under your collarbone. The catheter will be inserted through this small incision and tunneled under your skin to the first incision. The catheter will then be threaded into the vein. You may feel a pulling sensation.
A cuff surrounds part of the catheter that lies in the tunnel. This cuff will become anchored in the tunnel about 3 to 4 weeks after your procedure. It prevents bacteria from entering the tunnel and traveling up to your vein. This decreases your risk for infection. The cuff also prevents your catheter from falling out.
The incision near your collarbone will be stitched closed. The stitches will be absorbed and will not need to be removed. The outside of your incision will be covered with strips of adhesive tape. Your catheter will be stitched to your skin at the point where it exits your body so that it will stay in position. You will be able to see this thread around your catheter.
After Your Procedure
You may have some discomfort at your incision sites and along the tunnel. Ask your nurse for medication to relieve your pain.
Your dressings need to be left in place and kept dry for 48 hours following your procedure. Two days after your procedure, you can remove the dressing that covers the small incision near your collarbone. After that, you can leave it open to the air. The strips of adhesive tape that cover this incision should be left in place until they start to peel off. This should happen about 3 to 5 days after your procedure. The point where the catheter exits your skin will still need to be covered with a dressing. The stitch at this site keeps your catheter in place until the cuff becomes anchored in the tunnel under your skin.
Your catheter will not interfere with your usual activities, such as household tasks, job responsibilities, and exercise. However, we do suggest that you avoid contact sports, such as football and soccer, while your catheter is in place.
Prepare the following emergency kit and keep it with you at all times: * Two catheter caps
* One toothless clamp
* Alcohol swabs
* One roll of 2-inch tape
* Two 2x2 gauze pads
* Your doctors office and emergency telephone numbers
Changing Your Dressing and Catheter Caps
A nurse will teach you how to care for your catheter. You will learn how to use sterile technique to change your dressing. This will minimize your risk for infection. You can have a caregiver, family member, or friend learn with you.


You will see the folded Map for Dressing Change inside this booklet. Use it to follow the step-by-step instructions for changing your dressing. This is when you will use sterile technique. You will not be able to touch the booklet then because that would break sterile technique. You should open the map and spread it out where you can see it.
General instructions
* You will have time to practice catheter care with your nurse before you do it yourself. If you have any questions about your catheter care, please speak with your nurse.
* The Tegaderm&reg; dressing should be changed once a week, as long as it stays dry, intact, and clean. Change it on one of the days you are doing a cap change and a flushing. If you have problems with your skin, your nurse may suggest a different type of dressing. In that case, you may need to change it more often than once a week. No matter which dressing you have, always change it right away if it starts to come off or gets wet. Dont just reinforce it.
* Change the caps and flush the catheter twice a week, generally on Mondays and Fridays.
* Clamp the catheter when it is not in use.
* Dont do your catheter care in the bathroom.
* You may shower and bathe with the catheter in place using an Aquaguard&reg;. This is a one-time use waterproof cover that goes over your dressing. Each time you shower, cover the Tegaderm dressing completely with a new Aquaguard to protect it from getting wet.
 To put on the Aquaguard, peel off the top and side strips and place the top edge above your dressing. Smooth it down over your dressing. Do the same for the bottom part of your dressing, making sure that the bottom edge of the Aquaguard is below your dressing.
 Dont let the tape on the Aquaguard touch the Tegaderm dressing. It can lift your Tegaderm dressing when you remove the Aquaguard after showering. If your dressing gets wet, it needs to be changed.
* Dont submerge your catheter in water (e.g., a bathtub or swimming pool).
* Keep your catheter secure at all times to avoid pulling it. You can tape the lumens of your catheter to your skin, tuck them into a bra if you are female, or pin them to clothing. Ask your nurse about the best way to secure your catheter.
* If the exit site has drainage or is red, raw, or swollen, call your doctor. These may be signs of infection.
* If your catheter is leaking at any time, clamp it above the leak. Use the white catheter clamp on the catheter, if possible. Wipe the area that is leaking with an alcohol pad. Cover the site with tape. Call your doctor or nurse immediately. Catheters can often be repaired.
Equipment
* One CVS tray with caps (if you will be changing the caps)  One mask
 One pair of sterile gloves
 One ChloraPrep&reg; applicator
 Six alcohol prep pads
 One Tegaderm dressing


5
 One Biopatch&reg;
 One No Sting Barrier Film&reg; applicator  One poly-lined drape
 Two catheter caps
* An extra cap if you have 3 lumens
* One pair of nonsterile gloves
* Paper tape
* Three alcohol pads if you have 3 lumens
* A mirror that can stand up on a table (a make-up mirror works well)
Note: The catheter caps may have many names. This will depend on the manufacturer of the CVC dressing change tray. Some examples are needleless injection cap, ULTRASITE&reg; needleless valves, Saf-T PRN&reg;, and Clave&reg;. Some catheters dont have caps. Your nurse will tell you if your catheter has no caps.
Sterile procedure for changing your dressing
1. Prepare a clean area in which to work. Remember not to change your dressing in the bathroom.
2. Gather your equipment. Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and antibacterial soap. Dry them with a clean towel or paper towel.
3. Get into a comfortable position. Unpin the catheter from your clothing, if necessary. Open or remove your clothing to expose the catheter.
4. Check to make sure the catheter clamp(s) is (are) closed.
5. Open the Map for Dressing Change instructions enclosed in this booklet and spread it out where you can see it.
6. Open and remove the outer packaging of the dressing tray. The mask will be right on top (see Figure 2). Put it on. Dont touch anything else inside the tray.
7. If you will pin your catheter to your clothing, prepare one 5-inch piece of paper tape. Fold down the edges of the tape. Leave enough sticky tape
so you can wrap it around all of the lumens (see Figure 3).

8. Put on the nonsterile gloves and remove the old dressing. The Biopatch should come off with the dressing. Throw away the gloves and old dressing.
9. Without touching the area, inspect the catheter exit site and surrounding skin. It is easier to do this by looking in the mirror. Look for any signs of infection or irritation, such as
* Red or raw skin
* Swelling
* Any drainage from the catheter site
* Leakage around your catheter
Call your doctor or nurse after you complete the dressing change if you see any of these things.
10. Take the paper drape out of the tray. Unfold it and place it, shiny side down, on your work area.
Follow steps 11-20 on the Map for Dressing Change instructions to complete the dressing change. You are now done with the sterile part of the dressing change. Keep the gloves and mask on to change the
catheter caps and flush the catheter. This should be done twice a week.
Changing the catheter caps
21. You will change the caps on every lumen of your catheter. Make sure you have 2 alcohol pads for each lumen.
22. Open the sterile catheter caps by touching only the package over the tray and drop them back into the tray.
23. Check to make sure the clamps on the lumens are closed before you change the catheter caps.
24. Even though your gloves are on, they will no longer be sterile if you touched your skin when you put on the dressing. As you work, dont touch the inner part of the catheter tip or catheter cap. Grasp your catheter with the fist of your nondominant hand close to, but not touching, the cap (see Figure 4.) Keep your thumb and index fingers free.
25. Use your dominant hand to twist off the old catheter cap. Discard the old cap.
26. Clean the end of your catheter with a new alcohol pad.
27. Pick up the new catheter cap with your dominant hand. Use your thumb and index finger on your nondominant hand to remove the cover (see Figure 5). Twist the new catheter cap onto your catheter.
28. Repeat steps 21-26 for the second and third lumens.

Figure 5: Twisting on the new catheter cap

29. Clean each lumen from the cap to where it joins into 1 branch (see Figure 6). Use a separate alcohol pad for each lumen.
30. Remove your mask and sterile gloves. Discard them.
31. Decide on the most comfortable way for you to leave your catheter. You can
 Tuck it inside of your bra if you are female.
 Gather the 3 lumens with the paper tape, put a safety pin through the folded edges, and pin it to the inside of
your clothing.
 Tape it to your skin.
Leave the catheter hanging loose only if you are sure it will not be pulled.
Flushing Your Catheter
Flush the lumens with heparin 2 times a week, when your catheter is not in use. This is to keep the lines from becoming clogged.
Equipment
Figure 6: Cleaning the lumens
* One, 2, or 3 prefilled heparin syringes each containing 50 units of heparin. You will need one for each lumen
* Two alcohol pads for each lumen
Instructions for flushing your catheter
1. Pick up 1 lumen and unclamp it.
2. Wipe the end of the catheter cap with an alcohol pad.
3. Without touching the cleaned end of the catheter cap, remove the cap from the heparin syringe. Discard.
4. Carefully twist the heparin syringe into the catheter cap. If you cant inject the heparin, stop and check to be sure there are no twists or other blockages in the tubing. Try to inject the heparin again. If you still cant inject the heparin, dont use extra pressure to flush the line. Remove the syringe, reclamp your catheter, and call your doctor or nurse.
5. Use the following push/pause method to flush your catheter:
* Quickly inject 13 of the heparin.
* Pause.
* Repeat.
* Start injecting the last 13 of the heparin. As you are doing it, clamp your catheter. You will no longer be able to push fluid in once the clamp is closed.
6. Untwist the syringe from the lumen and discard the syringe.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for each lumen.


8. Secure your catheter in a way that makes you comfortable.
9. Throw away your mask and gloves and wash your hands thoroughly.
Call Your Doctor or Nurse if You
* Have redness, swelling, or drainage around the area where the catheter exits your body
* Are unable to flush your catheter
* Have a temperature of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher or chills when you flush your catheter * Have a break or leak in your catheter
* Have an unexplained problem with your catheter
