This information will help you care for your PICC at home.

A PICC is a long catheter (thin flexible tube) that is inserted into a vein in your upper arm. It may have 1, 2, or 3 ends, called lumens, depending on your treatment.     

Your PICC can be used for blood draws, as well as to receive

* Fluids
* Chemotherapy and other medicines 
* Blood transfusions
* Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) 

Your PICC will stay in place for your entire treatment, up to 18 months. It should not interfere with your normal activities, such as work, school, sexual activity, showering, or mild exercise. However, ask your doctor or nurse about any activities before starting them.  

Having Your PICC Placed

Your PICC will be put in by a doctor or a nurse. You will not need anesthesia (medicine to make you sleepy) when you have the PICC put in. The PICC is inserted into a vein in your arm, but the end of the PICC will be in your chest, near your heart. It will be held in place with a device (Statlock¨), Steri¨ Strips, or sutures. The insertion site is covered with a dressing to keep it clean. You will have a chest x-ray to make sure that the tip is in the right place.  

Your nurse will teach you, a family member, or friend how to take care of your PICC and your insertion site. You will be able to practice with the nurse before you do it at home. If needed, a nurse can come to your home and help you care for your PICC.

Caring for Your Insertion Site

You may have some bleeding and mild discomfort during the first 24 to 72 hours after your PICC is inserted. To help with this, put warm, moist compresses above the insertion site. If you have any bleeding from the site, apply cold compresses to the area. Call your doctor or nurse if the bleeding and discomfort does not get better after 72 hours or if it gets worse at any time. 

Keep your insertion site clean and dry while showering by covering it with a plastic bag or other material provided by your nurse.

Check your insertion site each day for

* Redness 
* Tenderness 
* Leakage
* Swelling
* Bleeding

DonÕt have any of the following on the arm where the PICC is inserted: 

* Needle sticks (such as for blood draws or intravenous [IV] catheter insertions)
* Blood pressure measurements
* Tight clothing or tourniquets

Prepare the following emergency kit and keep it with you at all times:  

* Two catheter caps
* One toothless clamp
* Alcohol swabs
* One roll of 2-inch tape
* Two 2x2 gauze pads
* Your doctorÕs office and emergency telephone numbers

Changing Your Dressing

Change the dressing of your PICC once a week, unless it is loose, damp/wet, or dirty. 

Sterile procedure for changing your dressing

1. Prepare a clean area in which to work. Remember not to change your dressing in the bathroom.
2. Gather your equipment. Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and antibacterial soap. Dry them with a clean towel or a paper towel.
3. Get into a comfortable position. Open or remove your clothing to expose the catheter.
4. Check to make sure the catheter clamp(s) is (are) closed.
5. Open the Map for Dressing Change instructions enclosed in this booklet and spread it out where you can see it.
6. Open and remove the outer packaging of the dressing tray. The mask will be right on top (Figure 2) Put the mask on. DonÕt  touch anything else inside the
tray.
7. Fold down the edges of one 5-inch piece of paper tape. Leave enough sticky tape so you can wrap it around all of the lumens (Figure 3).
8. Put on the nonsterile gloves and remove the old dressing. The Biopatch¨ should come off with the dressing. Throw away the gloves and the dressing.
9. Without touching the area, inspect the catheter exit site and surrounding skin. It is easier to do this by looking in the mirror. Look for any signs of infection or irritation. They can be

* Red or raw skin
* Swelling
* Any drainage from the catheter site
* Leakage around the catheter

Call your doctor or nurse after you complete the dressing change if you see any of these things.
10. Take the paper drape out of the tray. Unfold it and place it, shiny side down, on your work area.

Follow steps 11-20 on the Map for Dressing Change instructions to complete the dressing change.

You are now done with the sterile part of the dressing change. Keep your gloves and mask on to change the catheter cap and flush the catheter. This should be done twice a week.

Changing the Catheter Caps
21. You will change the catheter caps on all lumens of the catheter. You may have 1, 2, or 3 lumens. Make sure you have 3 alcohol pads for each lumen.
22. Open the sterile catheter caps by touching only the packaging and drop them back into the tray.
23. Check to make sure the clamps on the lumens are closed before you change the catheter caps.
24. Even though your gloves are on, they will no longer be sterile if you touched your skin when you put on the dressing. As you work, donÕt touch the inner part of the catheter tip or catheter cap. Grasp the catheter with the fist of your nondominant hand close to, but not touching the catheter cap (Figure 4). Keep your thumb and index fingers free.
25. Use your dominant hand to twist off the old catheter cap. Discard the old cap.
26. Clean the end of the catheter with a new alcohol pad.
27. Pick up the new catheter cap with your dominant hand. Use your thumb and index finger on your nondominant hand to remove the cover (Figure 5). Twist the new catheter cap onto the catheter.
28. Repeat steps 21-26 for the second and third lumens.
29. Clean each lumen from the catheter cap to where it joins into one branch (Figure 6). Use a separate alcohol pad for each lumen.
30. Remove your mask and sterile gloves. Discard them.

Flushing Your PICC

You must always flush your PICC after you have received antibiotics, TPN, chemotherapy, or blood products. This is to prevent it from becoming clogged. When your PICC is not being used, you must flush it every 7 days.  

Steps to flushing your PICC 

1. Gather a 10-mL syringe prefilled with 0.9% normal saline solution. You will need 1 syringe for each lumen in your PICC. Also gather alcohol swabs.
2. If there are any air bubbles in the syringe, gently tap the side of the syringe to release them. Point the syringe up as you do this. Press the plunger on the syringe until the air is pushed out.
3. Check to make sure that the PICC tubing is not twisted or blocked.
4. Wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and antibacterial soap. Dry them with a clean towel or a paper towel. Put on a pair of gloves. You donÕt need to wear sterile gloves to flush your PICC.
5. Wipe the end of the catheter cap with an alcohol swab.  
6. Connect the 10-mL syringe to the end of the catheter cap. Slowly inject the solution. If you canÕt inject the solution, stop and check to be sure there are no twists or other blockages in the tubing. Try to inject the solution again. If you still canÕt inject the solution, donÕt use extra pressure to flush the line. Call your doctor or nurse.
7. Throw away the syringe in a biohazard container.
8. Wash and dry your hands again. 

Caring for Your PICC 

If liquid is leaking while going into your PICC or when flushing your catheter, check that the catheter cap is on tightly. 

If liquid is leaking from the catheter, clamp it between the insertion site and leakage site with a toothless clamp. 

If the liquid is leaking from your insertion site, cover the site with sterile gauze. Turn the infusion off if the leaking happens while you are getting liquids.

Bard¨ Solo Power PICCs may be used during computed tomography (CT) scans. However, other types of PICCs cannot. If you have any questions about your PICC, ask your doctor or nurse.

* Shortness of breath
* A lightheaded or dizzy feeling
* Nausea and vomiting
* Confusion
* Discomfort in your chest
* Swelling in your hand, fingers, upper arm, or neck and mild aching in the arm where the PICC is inserted
