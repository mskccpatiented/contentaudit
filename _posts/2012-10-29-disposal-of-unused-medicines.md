Do not flush unused medicines down the drain or toilet. They damage our water supply and can harm wildlife. Controlled substances such as pain medicines can be misused.

To dispose of unused medicines:
* Remove them from their original container.
* Black out your name on prescription drug containers.
* Place them in a sealable plastic bag or non-recycled container. 
* Mix in coffee grounds, dirt, or kitty litter.
* Take them to a community waste collection event if possible. If the medicine is a controlled substance, check to see if the event is authorized to collect it. You can find out about collection events from:
* Your local pharmacy.
* Your local recycling coordinator.
* Your municipality.
* If there is no collection event in your community:
* Seal the bag or container with strong tape. 
* Place it in your trash as close to the day of pick-up as possible.
* Do not hide the unused medicines in food.
