Medical sharps include such things as a needle, syringe, or lancet. This card describes how to dispose of medical sharps safely.
 
* Choose an empty container with a tight cap. 
* It should be strong enough that needles cannot go through the sides and it should not be breakable. 
* Thick plastic detergent bottles and aluminum coffee cans are best. 
* Do NOT use paper or plastic bags.
* Clearly label the container Home Sharps. Keep it away from children and pets. 
* Do not overfill the container. When it is 60 to 80% full, reinforce the lid or cap with strong tape to create a more secure seal and prevent leakage. 
* Separate the container from trash that will be recycled.  
* If you live in New York City, you may place the sealed container in with your regular trash for collection. Do not place it with your recyclables. 
* If you live in a different county, check with your local department of health for instructions. 
* You may also bring the sealed container to:
*  Your nurse on your next clinic visit for safe disposal.
* Any non-federal hospital in New York State.

Please ask your nurse or call the number below if you have any questions.
