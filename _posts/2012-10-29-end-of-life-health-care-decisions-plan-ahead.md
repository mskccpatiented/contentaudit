This book will help you understand why end of life care planning is important and how you can protect your right to make your own decisions about your own medical care. 

At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) we encourage everyone to have conversations beginning early in their treatment about end of life care. We also recommend having these conversations throughout your care, especially when anything has changed. 

Advanced care planning is when you think ahead about the time when you may become terminally ill and give written or verbal directions about your care to someone you trust. We know that thinking ahead about medical choices can be difficult. However, discussing your care preferences with your health care team and your loved ones will help them make the treatment choices you would want and will ensure that you are getting the kind of care you would choose. 

### How To Protect Your Rights
Talk to your healthcare team, family and friends
Without knowing your wishes, your healthcare team will do what they think is best, but that might not be what you would want. Planning ahead gives you control. It is important if you know what you do or do not want at the end of your life you tell your team. 

If your family, your healthcare proxy, and your healthcare team knows what you want, they can do their best to help you have the kind of end of life care you would want. By talking about it ahead of time, they wont be faced with having to make a decision if you cant communicate. Often family members worry that they are not doing what their loved one would have wanted. Telling them before a decision needs to be made makes everyone more comfortable. 

### Health Care Proxy

#### What is a Healthcare Proxy?
A proxy is someone you choose to make health care decisions for you when you cant make them for yourself. If you become physical or mentally unable to make healthcare decisions, your health care proxy has legal authority to make decisions for you. 

Appointing a proxy and telling that person your preferences for care are important ways to ensure that you will actually receive the care you want. 

#### Is a healthcare proxy the same as a living will or MOLST?
No. A living will is a document that describes what types of care you would or would not want to receive at the end of life. A healthcare proxy is a person who you choose to make decisions for you. A proxy has the ability to use judgment and ask for more information so they can make sure any decision made directly correspond to your most currently medical condition.

MOLST stands for Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment. Unlike a living will or health care proxy, the MOLST is only used for people who have a serious condition or who are nearing the end of life. You can complete a living will or healthcare proxy form without ever talking to your health care team. However, the MOLST cannot be completed unless you and your doctor discuss and sign the form. The form has boxes to check if you do or do not want a DNR order. It also allows you to choose between three levels of care.

* Comfort Measures Only meaning you would be offered food and drink, but would not get them through a vein. You would only get medicine and other measures to relieve pain and made you more comfortable.
* Limited Medical Interventions lets you pick the specific things you would allow. For example you could use not have CPR started.
* No Limitations on Medical Interventions means that you will receive all medical treatments. 


#### Who can be a healthcare proxy?
A healthcare proxy can be a family member, a friend or anyone you trust.  Your proxy must be at least 18 years old and cannot be your doctor or any other member of your health care team. 

#### Who should I choose to be my healthcare proxy?
It is important you choose someone who:

* You are comfortable discussing serious issues with such as where you would prefer to receive care if you were very ill. 
* You trust to follow your health care choices and will respect your wishes, including religious or ethical beliefs. 
* Understands the role of a healthcare proxy and is willing to serve as one.
* Is able to communicate well with others.
* Can make difficult decisions.

#### What kinds of decisions can my healthcare proxy make?
A healthcare proxy can make most health care decisions for you if you cannot make them yourself. For example your proxy can decide if you should have:

* More treatment
* Different treatment or
* No Treatment

#### Are there things my healthcare proxy cannot do?

* Your healthcare proxy cannot make decisions for you if you are able to make them for yourself. If you can communicate and show that you are able to understand your treatment options, your health care team will encourage you to make your own decisions about your treatment. 
* Your healthcare proxy is involved in medical decisions only and does not have legal authority to make decisions for you about your finances or any other subject.

#### How do I officially name my healthcare proxy?
To officially name someone your healthcare proxy, complete a healthcare proxy form. You do not need a lawyer or a notary to complete this form.  This form becomes valid once you sign and date it in front of two witnesses. Anyone who is 18 or older can be your witness; however, your health care proxy cannot be your witness. Your witness will also sign your proxy form.  Give a copy of your completed healthcare proxy form to your healthcare provider and your healthcare proxy. You should also keep a copy for yourself. 

##### What should I tell my healthcare proxy?
Your healthcare proxy should understand your wishes about your future medical care so they are able to make decisions on what you would want.  Here are some questions we recommend you both discuss.

* What are my biggest concerns and fears about my medical future?
* How important is it for me to be independent? 
* How much am I willing to go through to extend my life?
* Are there certain situations in which I would not want intensive medical treatment?

You should discuss how you feel about specific procedures. Talk with your proxy about your feelings on the following 

#### Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
CPR is done if your heart stops beating or you stop breathing. Pressure is used on your chest to try and restart your heart. A breathing tube is put in your airway and a machine makes your lungs breathe. Would you want CPR started?

#### Intubation and mechanical ventilation
Intubation is the process of inserting a tube into your mouth and then into your airway. This is done so that you can be placed on a mechanical ventilator. A mechanical ventilator is a machine that sends airs into your lungs and can help you breathe when you cannot breathe on you own.  Would you want to be placed on a breathing machine? Are there certain situations in which you would not want to be put on a breathing machine? 

#### Artificial hydration and nutrition
Artificial nutrition and hydration adds to or replaces ordinary eating and drinking by giving nutrients and fluids through a tube placed directly into a persons stomach. It can also be placed into the nose and down into the stomach or done through a vein.  It can be used to get you through a treatment that might help you recover. Artificial hydration and nutrition can be used to get you through a treatment that might help you recover but it could also be used to keep your body alive if you are unconscious and there was very little chance you could regain conscious. Would you want to receive artificial hydration and nutrition?

#### Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) 
A DNR order means that a patient or health care proxy has instructed your healthcare team not to restart your heart should it stop suddenly. It allows you to have a natural death.  For example, if you had a DNR order, no one could put in a breathing tube and connect you to a breathing machine. Is having a DNR order something you would be interested in? 

If you would like to have a DNR order you must discuss it with your healthcare team as the order can only be written if you agree to it.

If you are not currently an inpatient and would like a DNR you can have your doctor issue a non hospital DNR order. This will tell all healthcare providers not to use CPR or any other live saving procedures. If you do not have a DNR, health care providers will do everything medically possible to restart your heart and help you breathe. For example if your family calls 911 and emergency health care team arrives, they must be shown the DNR. Otherwise, they must start CPR if you have no heartbeat. This is also true if you are in hospice care or under a visiting nurses care. It is therefore very important your proxy knows where your DNR order is at all times.
