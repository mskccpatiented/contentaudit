An fMRI allows surgeons to see the areas of the brain that control speech and movement. They use this information to decide if surgery is safe. Most peoples brains are organized in a similar way. However, lesions in the brain can cause the speech and movement functions to move around. An fMRI maps these functions. This is done by asking you to perform certain tasks. When you do these tasks it helps the doctor find the speech and movement areas in your brain. This allows your doctor to see how your brain is organized. This information is then used to make decisions about your surgery. 

### The Brain
In most people, speech is controlled by the left side of the brain. There are two main areas that are of most concern to surgeons. These are at the front and side of the brain. One area controls the production of speech. Another controls the reception or understanding of speech. The area that controls movement in the brain is organized into body parts. The right side of your body is controlled by the left side of the brain. The left side of your body is controlled by the right side of your brain. 

### Explanation Of Procedure:

1. The MRI machine may affect:

* Some implants.
* Devices such as pacemakers.
* Metal, such as shavings in the eye.
* Medication patches. 

Prior to the fMRI, you will fill out a questionnaire about any medical implants or devices you may have. Patients with these devices may not go into the scanning room.If you do have an implant, ask your doctor about the exact type of device and the manufacturer. The manufacturer can tell you if it is safe for you to have an MRI. This information is very important because it will determine if it is safe for you to have this test. 

2. Once you are cleared, you will change into a hospital gown before going into the scanning area. You will place your clothes and any metal objects (such as jewelry, coins, or glasses) in a locker. You should also place any credit, ATM, or debit cards in the locker. The MRI magnet will erase the information on the magnetic strip on these cards.

3. You will be taken to the scanning room and assisted onto the MRI table. The MRI machine is a large donut-shaped magnet. It makes a loud tapping noise while the scan is in progress. You will be given ear phones to wear. You may also be given goggles. When you are on the MRI table, the technologist will slide you into the magnetic part of the machine. You will be able to speak with the technologist during the entire scan.

4. While you are lying in the MRI scanner, you will be asked to do certain tasks. You will be able to hear the technologist or clinician over the head phones. He or she will give you instructions for each task. You may also see instructions on a mirror above you or through the goggles.
 
5. The tasks you are asked to do will depend on the location of your brain lesion. They will be related to movement or language. You will be asked to perform a task for about 20 seconds and then you will rest. If the surgeon is concerned about movement, you will be asked to move your tongue, fingers, or feet. If the surgeon is concerned about language, you will be asked to do some simple word tasks.

6. When your MRI is complete, the scanning table will be moved from the machine and you will be helped off the table. After you retrieve your belongings, you may leave the MRI suite.

### PREPARATION FOR THE PROCEDURE

* No special preparation is required. You may take your medicine(s) as usual.
* If you are getting medicine through a patch on your skin, remove it before entering the MRI suite. This is because any metal on the patch can heat up and cause burns during the MRI. Many patches have metal, some do not. Because we cannot know all products, we have made it our policy that any patch must be removed for your safety. Bring an extra patch with you to put on after the MRI. A Fentanyl patch does not need to be removed. It is the only exception to our policy. 
* If it is hard for you to lie still for about an hour or if you fear being in a narrow or small space, speak with your doctor before your procedure. Most patients who have trouble with this during MRI exams do NOT have trouble with fMRI exams. This is because you will be constantly responding to the person doing the fMRI. If needed, medicine may be prescribed for your comfort. 
* If you wear contact lenses, it is best to wear them the day of the fMRI. This will make it easier to see the stimuli presented to you while you are in the MRI.
* Before your fMRI, the tasks that you will be asked to perform will be explained to you. You will go over these tasks so that you are familiar with them when the exam starts. 

### Day Of The Procedure

Enter the main hospital through the 68th Street entrance. Turn left and take a C bank elevator bank to the eleventh floor. When you get off, turn right and proceed to the end of the hallway to the MRI suite. 

The fMRI takes about 30-45 minutes. This will depend on your particular case. 

### After The Procedure

* There are no restrictions after your fMRI and no special care is needed. 
* A radiologist will send a report to the doctor who ordered the scan.
