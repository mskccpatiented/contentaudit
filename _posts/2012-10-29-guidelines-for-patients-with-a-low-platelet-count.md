Platelets are colorless cells that are a part of blood.  They are produced in bone marrow, the soft, spongy center in most of our large bones.  The main function of platelets is to control bleeding.  A normal platelet count is 150,000-400,000 platelets per microliter (mcl) of blood.

If your doctor has told you that you have a low platelet count, it is very important that you take precautions to prevent bleeding.  You must also recognize any signs of bleeding so you can report them to your doctor or nurse.  Precautions and signs of bleeding are listed below. Your platelet count may be low because of the cancer or its treatment. 

Protective measures to avoid bleeding:
* Self-Care
- Avoid sharp objects such as a straightedge razor, scissors, and nail clippers.
- Use a soft toothbrush.
- Blow your nose gently, if at all.
* Perineal care
- Do not use rectal suppositories, enemas, or tampons.  
- Do not take your temperature rectally.  
- Consider using stool softeners or laxatives if you are straining to have bowel movements.
* Dressing
- Avoid tight clothing such as a girdle and tight undergarments or pants.
* Activities
- Wear gloves when gardening, cooking, and doing home repairs.
