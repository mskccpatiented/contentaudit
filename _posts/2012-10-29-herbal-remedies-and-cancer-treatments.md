Fact Card 

One week before you have surgery or start chemotherapy, you must stop taking any herbal or botanical home remedies.

Some of these can:
* Interact with other drugs. 
* Increase or lower blood pressure. 
* Thin the blood and raise the risk of bleeding. 
* Make radiation therapy less effective.
* Lower the effects of medicines that suppress the immune system. 
* Increase the effects of medicine that numbs the body or makes you fall asleep for surgery
