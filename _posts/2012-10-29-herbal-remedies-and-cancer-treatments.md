One week before you have surgery or start chemotherapy, you must stop taking any herbal or botanical home remedies.

Some of these can:

* Interact with other drugs. 
* Increase or lower blood pressure. 
* Thin the blood and raise the risk of bleeding. 
* Make radiation therapy less effective.
* Lower the effects of medicines that suppress the immune system. 
* Increase the effects of medicine that numbs the body or makes you fall asleep for surgery 

Below are examples of some common herbs and a description of their effects.

### Acai Berry
Due to the way it interacts with chemicals in the body (its antioxidant effects), acai may get in the way of the actions of certain chemotherapy drugs.

### Echinacea 

* May cause an allergic reaction such as a rash or difficulty breathing. 
* Lowers the effect of drugs used to hold back the immune system.

### Garlic 
* Lowers blood pressure and fat and cholesterol levels.
* Prevents platelets (the blood cells that help stop bleeding) from sticking together. This increases the risk of bleeding.

### Ginkgo (Also known as Ginkgo biloba)
May change how platelets work. This can increase the risk of bleeding.

### Ginseng

* May act as  to increase nervous activity in the body. It could decrease the effects of medicine that numbs the body or makes you fall asleep for surgery
* May get in the way with how platelets work. This can increase the risk of bleeding.
* Lowers blood glucose (sugar) level. 

### Turmeric
* May reduce the anti-tumor action of some chemotherapy drugs. 

### St. John's Wort 
* Could interact with medicines that you may be given during surgery.
* May make the skin more sensitive to laser treatment. 

### Valerian 
May have a sedative-hypnotic effect that could increase the effects of medicine that numbs the body or makes you fall asleep for surgery.* 

### Herbal Formulas
Many herbal preparations have different herbs. We do not know their side effects. You must also stop taking these products one week before and during treatment.
