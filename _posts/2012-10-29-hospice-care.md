Hospice care provides comfort and symptom management. It supports patients' and families' physical, emotional, social, and spiritual needs. Your doctor may suggest hospice care when treatment is no longer aimed at curing your cancer. When pain and other symptoms are controlled, the patient can live each day as fully as possible. Hospice does not speed up or delay death. It provides comfort and support during this time. 

The hospice team is made up of doctors, nurses, social workers, clergy, physical therapists and volunteers. These are people who are dedicated to working with patients with advanced disease and their families. 

Hospice care is most often provided in the home. However, services can also be provided:

* In a hospital. 
* At a nursing home. 
* In a free standing facility that is dedicated to hospice care. 

Hospice services are covered by Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance companies. 

Patients and their families have many different wishes and needs. What works for one patient may not work for others. There are many choices within hospice care and your team will work with you to choose the best option for you. 

Once you and your family have made a decision regarding hospice care, your doctor will make a referral. A nurse, social worker or case manager can assist with the referral. Most hospice services will accept patients with a life expectancy of 6 months or less. Services may be extended longer than 6 months if a doctor certifies that the patient is terminally ill. 
  
Please speak with your doctor, nurse, or social worker if you have any questions or concerns about hospice care.
