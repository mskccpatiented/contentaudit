Sleeping well at night can make you feel better and give you more energy. It can also help you fight off infections and heal your wounds.

Some patients have problems sleeping while they are in the hospital. Disruptions to your natural sleep patterns can be caused by:

Lighting in the room:

* Lighting is too bright during the night
* Lighting is too dark during the day

Treatments and procedures during the night:

* Taking vital signs
* Drawing blood and doing other tests  
* Giving out medicines
* Caring for your roommate 

Side effects of medicines:

* Medicines that keep you from falling asleep
* Medicines that make you sleepy (e.g. pain medicines) 

Symptoms related to your cancer or treatment:

During the Day:

### Deep Breathing Exercise
Deep breathing is an exercise that can help you relax. It is very simple, and you can teach it to yourself. It can help you clear your mind, release tension, and sleep better. You can do it any time you feel stressed or anxious.

1. Get into a comfortable position in a chair or in your bed. Raise your head as much as possible.
2. Place one hand on your stomach, just below your ribs. If you are right handed, use your right hand; if you are left handed, use your left hand.
3. Exhale completely through your mouth.
4. If you can, close your eyes and inhale slowly and deeply through your nose.
Feel your stomach push up on your hand. Imagine that air is filling your whole body from the bottom up.
5. Pause for a couple of seconds. Then, exhale slowly through your mouth or nose. Try
to exhale completely and imagine the air leaving your lungs, mouth, or nose.
6. As you exhale, allow your body to relax and go limp like a rag doll.
7. Repeat the exercise 5 to 10 times.

### Ease your mind
If you cant get your mind off of your worries, make a list of things you are worried about. Then, write down what you can do to decrease that worry. For example, you might ask the doctor about a symptom or talk about your fears with a friend or family member. Tell yourself that you will do those things the next day

If you cannot fall asleep, get up and take a short walk. You can also try a light activity, such as reading a book or doing a crossword puzzle for 30 minutes. Then, do a relaxation activity
It can be helpful to bring some things from home to help you sleep and feel more comfortable. These items can include:

* Earplugs
* Eye mask  
* Earphones
* Bathrobe 
* Slippers
* Pillow
