This information will help you avoid infection while your white blood cell count is low. This is called neutropenia.

Neutrophils are white blood cells (WBC). They help your body fight infections. You must follow the instructions described on this card to prevent infection until your neutrophil count returns to normal. You should also be aware of signs of infection and report them to your doctor or nurse. Be sure to take your temperature orally (by mouth), as directed by your doctor or nurse.

### General Hygiene
Shower or bathe daily. Wash carefully under your arms, in the anal and genital areas, and in skin folds.

Use soap that can kill germs. Look for the words antibacterial or antimicrobial. Dial is one example, but there are many others.

Perform mouth care after each meal. Use an ultra-soft toothbrush and brush and rinse as directed by your doctor or nurse.

Use antibacterial hand gels (such as Purell) after shaking hands and after contact with young children.
