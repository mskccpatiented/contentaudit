# Outpatient Clinic
#### The Morning Before Transplant
On the morning of Day 0, your transplant day, you and your caregiver should come to the outpatient clinic at your scheduled time. Give yourself extra time to get to the clinic, as you may feel tired after your chemotherapy. 

You should bring the following items to the clinic with you:

* A list of all prescription and non-prescription medications you are taking, along with the dosages and frequency. This should include patches, creams, vitamins, nutritional supplements, herbal products, and over-the-counter medications. 
* A notebook to write down key pieces of information and any questions you or your caregiver may have.
* The Temperature and Oral Intake diary you and your caregiver have been using to record your temperature and fluid intake.
* Newspapers, books, a laptop, or tablet computer to pass the time.

Once you arrive at the clinic an NP will review your Temperature and Oral Intake Diary and will ask you a set of questions. You will be brought to a private room for a physical exam and your vital signs will be checked.



### The Outpatient BMT Clinic
**Edit: During the phase of treatment while you are cared for in the outpatient setting** After your transplant you will receive all your care in the Outpatient BMT Clinic&mdash;the same place where you had your chemotherapy and your transplant. Each morning you will return to the clinic, just like you did on the mornings before chemotherapy and your transplant. 

You should arrive at the clinic at your scheduled time. You will remain at the clinic for most of the day. **Edit: You will be cared for in a private room that has a bed and bathroom. There is a bedside entertainment uint with a TV and a computer. A light breakfast and lunch will be provided for you.**

When you come to the clinic you should wear every-day, comfortable clothing that allows for easy access to your catheter; shirts that open at the front, sweatshirts, and large t-shirts. Avoid wearing clothing that is too difficult to take off or put back on again. 

You should bring these items to the clinic with you each day:

* A list of all prescription and non-prescription medications you are taking, along with with dosages and frequency. This should include patches, creams, vitamins, nutritional supplements, herbal products and over-the-counter medications. 
* All the prescription medications you were instructed to take during the bone marrow transplant period.
* Your temperature and oral intake diary.
* Books, newspapers, an audio player, a laptop or tablet computer&mdash;whatever you need to pass the time. 

Once you arrive, you will check in with the session assistant. 

Once you've checked in, you'll be brought to your room. Your NP will sit with you and your caregiver and will ask you series of questions about how you feel. Your NP will do a physical exam, and then check your vital signs. Your NP will check the temperature and oral intake diary.

Some of your blood will be taken daily and sent for testing. Your blood will be checked to see how your white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets are recovering. Your blood will also be used to check the health of your kidneys, measure your electrolyte levels and identify any signs of infection, such as the presence of harmful bacteria or viruses. 

Once you've been examined, you will wait in your room in the clinic for your test results to return. This can take several hours. This is a good time for your caregiver to take a break; he or she can take some personal time or run errands. You will be safe in the care of your healthcare team. We highly recommend that caregivers leave the hospital and take this time to unwind.

After several hours, your test results (sometimes referred to as "labs") will come back from the lab. Your healthcare team will analyze the results and will make decisions about your care. The rest of your visit to the clinic that day will depend on your test results.

Here are some things that can happen based on the results of your tests:

* You could be given fluids to hydrate you.
* You could be given an infusion of platelets, red blood cells or other blood components.
* Your medication could be changed.
* Your treatment could be left as is.

All of this will be explained to you. You'll remain in the clinic until any actions the healthcare team have recommended have been completed. Once your healthcare team is happy, you'll be free to leave. You'll return to your apartment or hotel, where your caregiver will continue to monitor your temperature and fluid intake. 

You'll continue to make daily visits to the clinic until your healthcare team decides that you can come less regularly. 

If at any time you need more care than can be provided to you in the outpatient clinic you will be admitted to the inpatient BMT unit.



#### The Morning before Chemotherapy - The Outpatient BMT Clinic
On the morning of your treatment you and your caregiver will make the first of your regular visits to the Outpatient BMT Clinic. You'll return to the clinic each day until your healthcare team tells you otherwise.

You should bring these items to the clinic with you:

* A list of all prescription and non-prescription medications you are taking, along with dosages and frequency. This should include patches, creams, vitamins, nutritional supplements, herbal products, and over-the-counter medications. 
* A notebook to write down key pieces of information and any questions you or your caregiver may have.

You can expect to be in the BMT Clinic for 6 to 10 hours, so you might want to bring newspapers, books, a laptop or tablet computer&mdash;things to pass the time. While you're at the clinic, you'll be provided with meals and there is a lounge with coffee and tea for caregivers.

You and your caregiver should arrive at the clinic at the main hospital at your scheduled time. You should wear comfortable, loose everyday clothes; loose fitting tops or shirts that open to the front (so that we can access your catheter), comfortable pants (sweat pants or track suit). 

Once you arrive at the clinic you will be brought to your own private room. An NP will review your medical history and ask you a set of questions about how you're feeling. Your vital signs will be checked and you will be weighed. 

Once you have been fully evaluated, you will meet with your clinical pharmacist. Your pharmacist will explain the medications you will take throughout your treatment and will show you how to use your pill box. Your pharmacist will give you all the medications that you need to take, along with a list that tells you when to take each different medication.
