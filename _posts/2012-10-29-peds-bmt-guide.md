Dear Patients &Family Members:
We know that you are reading this because you or someone that you care about has an immune disorder or bone marrow failure. We want you to know that you are not alone. This is a challenging time. With time and experience, however, patients and families become familiar with the medical center and the places where treatment is given. They memorize the route and all the shortcuts from home to the hospital. They master the way to the cafeteria. They find the spots that offer privacy. They bring blankets and pictures from home to brighten rooms. They pack snacks, toys, and books for clinic visits. They learn to navigate the miles of hallways. The staff become real people and some important relationships are formed. Patients and their families adjust to their new world and become reluctant experts.
To help you through this journey, we have a care team working to treat the immune disorder or bone marrow failure and support young people and their families during and after treatment.
This handbook can help you learn how to take part in their care and manage the illness, its treatment, and the follow-up afterward. Since this book is being read by the parents of younger kids as well as older kids that are starting treatment, it is written directly to the patient. Therefore, when we say you, we are talking about the patient.
We hope that you find this handbook helpful. We encourage you to review it and discuss it with your doctor or nurse. Lastly, we also hope you let us know what you think of it, and give us your suggestions for future editions. That way, youll be helping us help other families who are facing the challenge of childhood immune disorder or bone marrow failure.
Sincerely,
The MSKCC Pediatric Cancer Team
 Please send all suggestions to the Office of Patient and Family Education

Pediatric Care Team Roles
Pediatric patients are treated by a medical team that specializes in immune disorders and marrow failure syndromes. The team model ensures that all aspects of your care are addressed. Your care team is available to offer support and address your concerns.
Physicians
Attending physicians are full-time faculty members. They are actively involved in patient care, teaching, and ongoing research. Other physician staff members include fellows in pediatric hematology oncology and residents who work in the inpatient unit. Physician staff members will determine your child's care at MSKCC. They will often consult with each other about the best treatment modalities for you.
Radiation Oncologists
Radiation Oncologists are cancer doctors who decide if radiation therapy is needed as part of treatment. They meet with families to discuss all aspects of the therapy. The Radiation Oncologists design radiation treatment to target tumors and minimize contact to nearby healthy tissues or organs. A patient receiving radiation therapy will meet with the Radiation Oncologist regularly during and after therapy.
Nurse Practitioners
Nurse practitioners (NPs) are registered nurses with an advanced academic and clinical education. They combine the strengths of nursing with other clinical skills. They work closely with doctors to manage your treatment.
Registered Nurses
Registered nurses (RNs) provide essential, critical bedside care. They are skilled in decreasing the anxiety that a child or family member may experience. They work closely with the NPs and attendings to talk about any changes in the condition of the patients. They also work closely with the psychosocial support team to address various aspects of treatment, healing, and recovery.
An important part of our nursing mission at MSKCC is primary nursing care. Each patient is assisted by the same nurse for his or her entire stay or for each visit to the Center. Because of this, nurses are able to build a relationship with patients. This helps them to notice any small changes in patients' responses to treatment.
About MSKCC
  1

Nursing Assistants
Nursing assistants support the registered nurses with basic bedside care. They also assist with general assessments and help with patient flow.
Social Workers
A social worker is assigned to each pediatric care team. He or she provides counseling, offers information and assistance during the course of treatment. He or she can guide and direct you to resources you may need. Social workers can also help with the psychological and social aspects of a cancer diagnosis. You can contact a social worker prior to your first visit if you have questions. He or she can help you make accommodations nearby, and tell you about assistance programs that are available.
Child Life Staff
The Child Life Specialists are trained to make a child's hospital experience as smooth as possible. They offer a variety of age-appropriate activities in the Recreation Center and at bedside. Child life staff can help patients as they learn to adapt and cope with this difficult experience.
Teachers
MSKCC provides a teaching program, staffed by teachers who are all certified by the New York City Board of Education. This program provides schooling for elementary, middle school, and high schools students who are at MSKCC for longer periods. Patients can take New York State standardized tests (including NYS Regents Examinations). They can also get help with college applications, and graduation requirements.
Chaplains
Religion is an important source of comfort and strength for many of our patients. As a result, MSKCC provides the services of Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, and Muslim chaplains. Visits from clergy of other religions can also be arranged. There is a chapel near the main lobby on the first floor of Memorial Hospital. It is always open to members of any faith for meditation and prayer. Religious services are held every week and on all holy days.
Session Assistants
Session Assistants are part of the check-in process and monitor patient flow. They assist attendings and nurse practitioners. They schedule appointments, manage medical records, and track each patient's daily progress. This includes any scans, tests, and treatment given.
Physician Office Assistants
Physician Office Assistants provide administrative support to attending staff. You may speak with this person when you submit information or when you have questions for the physician.

Hospital Facilities
Pediatric Day Hospital
When you step off the elevator, you are greeted with our Welcome Wall. A colorful loop of welcome messages, special announcements, and artwork appear on the wall. There is a small Touch Screen, located to the right of the Welcome Wall. It offers a menu of visitor options, from directions to doctors' offices to what food is being served in the cafeteria. You can also find a listing of area restaurants or information on New York City family attractions.
The Gallery Wall
Next is the waiting area, which is home to our very own Gallery Wall. The Gallery Wall is made up of artwork that patients, their siblings, and friends made to make people feel welcome. Working with The Artists at Jerard Studio, in Brooklyn, the kids built giant sculptures and artwork to mount on the wall. Exhibits are changed periodically.
Clinical Areas
A wall full of colorful, changing lights greets patients as they go into the clinical exam space. The 15 exam rooms are designed to have room for patients and family members. Medical exams are done here by the clinical team that cares for you.
This area also includes a chemotherapy pharmacy and consultation rooms.
There are also satellite blood and hematology labs, as well as an IV room for easy access and for brief medicine administrations.
Inpatient Rooms
Children who require inpatient admission reside on the same floor. Inpatient rooms have entertainment and computer systems at the bedside. You can join in group activities from your bed and stay in touch with family, friends, and local schools.
All inpatient rooms have parent accommodations at the bedside. An Activity Center is located in the Family Lounge. Books, movies, toys, and computers are available there. This is a quiet, warm, and soothing space for patients and families.

The Day Bed Area
The day bed area is where patients receive extended treatment or undergo observation. The majority of treatment bays are private. Each bed has a flat screen TV,
VCR, a DVD/CD player, and Internet access. The skylight above the day bed area lets in plenty of sun, and there are seats nearby for family members.
The Pediatric Day Hospital also has a separate, private waiting area to meet the needs of patients who are post-transplant.
The Pantry
The pantry in the Pediatric Day Hospital offers beverages, cereal, and sandwiches throughout the day at no cost. Special treats are available on certain days. For patients admitted for extended treatment, daily room service is available.
The Recreation Center
The Recreation Center is the core of our Day Hospital community. The center features many activity areas designed for young children. It also includes an in-house television station that can be viewed on our pediatric channel. This allows patients in the day bed area or the inpatient unit to watch and listen to special events taking place without leaving their beds.
The Teen Room
The Teen Room is only for teens and young adults. No one under 13 is allowed inside. And, by teen majority vote, parents are not allowed to enter either, except by permission on special occasions. There are computers, surround sound, special video games, and a plasma screen TV inside. This room is a special place where teens can get away from the rest of the Pediatric Day Hospital.
The Laura Rosenberg Procedure Suite
The Laura Rosenberg Procedure Suite is situated between the Pediatric Day Hospital and the inpatient units. All invasive procedures, such as bone marrow aspirates or lumbar punctures are performed here. The suite also includes an adjacent recovery area.

Before Treatment Information
Allogeneic Blood Stem Cell Transplantation
An allogeneic blood stem cell transplant replaces your stem cells with new, healthy ones from a donor. Allogeneic means that the stem cells come from a donor other than yourself. You will have chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both, to kill your cancer and suppress your immune system. This will damage your normal bone marrow. You will then receive the transplant of the donor stem cells. They are given into a vein, usually through your central venous intravenous (IV) catheter. They may be infused from a bag, like a blood transfusion, or from a large syringe attached to your catheter. This will take place in your hospital room.
Blood stem cell transplants are used to treat many diseases. These include leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, aplastic anemia, other tumors, and immune deficiencies that are present from birth. The care you need before a transplant depends on your disease. Your doctor will tell you why a transplant is used, why you cannot use your own stem cells, and what treatment plan is best for you.
The Donor
Not everyone can be your donor. The right donor is someone whose tissue type most closely matches yours. Tissue typing is based on your human leukocyte antigens (HLA). These are found on the surface of your white blood cells. They are important for immunity because they help your body recognize your own cells so they do not attack them. If foreign cells enter your body, your white blood cells will see them as foreign and will mount an attack to get rid of them.
A person with a close HLA match is most often a brother or sister. Family members will have a blood test to see what tissue type they have. The person whose tissue type is most like yours is chosen to be the donor. If no one is a close match, your doctor will help you start a search with a donor registry, cord blood banks, or both. The donor gives stem cells for the transplant and may also be needed to donate platelets after the transplant.
People who are not related can have a close match by chance. If you do not have a family member with a matching tissue type, we look for an unrelated adult volunteer donor or cord blood units. The National Marrow Donor Program has millions of people registered who have had their blood typed for this purpose. However, the search for a donor may take weeks or even months to complete. Sometimes cord blood will be used if the transplant is urgent, as this is available more quickly. If you will need stem cells from someone who is not related to you, your doctor will give you a more detailed explanation.
Clinical Trials
Survival rates for childhood cancer have soared over the past 20 years. Much of the improvement is the result of new therapies developed at centers specializing in childhood cancer. Pediatric doctors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center are leaders in establishing new, more effective treatments for pediatric cancers through
32

clinical trials. Many of these innovations have been responsible for changing some cancers from incurable to curable.
Most blood or marrow transplants are done as part of a study. When patients are on a study we test new ways of treating them that we think may be better than the old ways. We collect information about the result of this treatment so we can understand if these changes were helpful or not. This is so we can learn better ways to treat our patients. Some patients receive "standard of care" treatment. These treatments plans were once part of a clinical trial, but are now accepted to be the most effective way to treat the patient's cancer. For other patients, the best approach to treatment of their cancers is not known. To learn more about how to diagnose and treat your cancer you may be asked to take part in a clinical trial, which is sometimes called a medical or research study.
Studies have shown that children's survival rates are raised by 20 to 40 percent if their cancer care is coordinated by pediatric oncologists that follow established clinical trial protocols. Protocols describe the guidelines for treatment. They explain what the trial will do, and how the study will be done. Cancer centers may have their own protocols or protocols may be shared among several institutions. Every physician or research institution that takes part in a clinical trial uses the same protocol. This ensures that patients are treated in the same way and that the information from all participating centers can be combined and compared.
Myeloablative Transplant versus Non-Myeloablative Transplant
There are two approaches to treatment before an allogeneic transplant. One is called myeloablative. In this approach, you receive high doses of chemotherapy with or without radiation. These treatments aim to kill your cancer but also kill (myeloablate) all stem cells in your bone marrow. The donor stem cells will then replace the ones killed by the treatment. This form of treatment is very intense and it may not be suitable for all patients.
Another approach involves a less intense treatment. It uses lower doses of chemotherapy with or without low doses of radiation. It also includes drugs that suppress your immune system. This type of transplant is called a non-myeloablative. It aims to keep your immune system and stem cells in check rather than destroying them. This will still allow the donor stem cells to "engraft" in most cases.
Your doctor will consider many factors when choosing which type of transplant is best for you. These include your disease, other treatments you have received, and your general health status. Your doctor will discuss these factors in detail with you.
33

Tests
Before your treatment begins, there are several tests or procedures you may have to undergo.
 Chest x-ray
 Blood tests
 Urine test
 Electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (ECHO), MUGA scan  tell us how your
heart is functioning.
 Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)  breathing tests to see how well your lungs work.
 CT or PET scan - may be used to see where tumors are in your body, to plan your
radiation treatments, or both.
 Bone marrow biopsy  gives us a sample of your bone marrow and tells us about the
state of your blood cells. It is done before your transplant, three to four weeks after
your transplant, and then every three months for the first year. The timing may vary.
 Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)  This lets us check for abnormal cells in your spinal fluid. A small needle is inserted through your back and a small amount of fluid is
withdrawn. A lumbar puncture is only done for certain types of leukemia. Your doctor or nurse will explain to you any other tests you may need.

If you are going to have radiation as part of your treatment, you will meet with the radiation therapy team before you are admitted. You may also have a CT scan or PET scan or both to plan your treatment. You will also have a planning session called simulation. During this session, several x-rays are taken along with measurements of your chest. These are used to make lead shields. Your lungs are very sensitive to radiation and the shields will be used to protect them during some of the treatments (See section on Total Body Irradiation).
Dental Exam
You will have a dental exam. Decayed teeth and gums can cause serious infections in patients being treated with high doses of chemo or radiation. If possible, we would like you to see a dentist at MSKCC. We must be sure that anything that could cause an infection in your mouth is fixed before your transplant. For example, you may need cavities filled, loose fillings replaced, or gum disease treated. Mouth care will be very important for the entire time you are in the hospital.
A Central Venous Line (Catheter)
A central venous line is an intravenous (IV) line that can stay in place for many months. Hickman, Broviac, and Hohn catheters are examples of central venous IV catheters. You will need to have one of these because fluids, medicines, blood products, and stem cells are given through it. Most, but not all, blood samples can also be drawn from the catheter. Central venous lines are usually placed the day of admission or several days before.

Facts about Blood and Blood Cells
Blood is made up of four parts: red cells, white cells, platelets, and plasma. The function of blood is to carry oxygen and nutrients to all cells of the body. Blood cells also fight infection and control bleeding.
Red Blood Cells (Erythrocytes):
Red cells transport oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and bring the waste product, carbon dioxide, back to the lungs where it is exhaled.
Two tests are done to measure the number and function of red blood cells: hemoglobin and hematocrit. Hemoglobin shows how much oxygen the red blood cells are able to carry. Hematocrit is the percentage of red blood cells in the blood.
White Blood Cells (Leukocytes):
Their main function is to fight infection and help develop immunity. There are three types of white blood cells: granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Each type has specific functions described below.
 Neutrophils help fight bacterial and fungal infection.
 Eosinophils help during parasitic infection.
Monocytes help to fight infection by killing and removing bacteria. Lymphocytes are cells that make up the immune system.
You will hear the term ANC which stands for Absolute Neutrophil Count. The ANC is the total number of neutrophils in your childs white blood cell count. The lower the ANC drops, the higher the risk of infection.
Platelets (Thrombocytes):
Platelets are colorless cells whose main function is to control bleeding. When the platelet count is low, you are at risk for bleeding.
Plasma:
Plasma is the liquid part of blood. It transports water, nutrients, minerals, and hormones and carries various waste products to the kidneys for removal from the body.
The Complete Blood Count (CBC)
A complete blood count is a blood test done to find out if the bone marrow is working normally. A CBC describes the number, type, and form of each blood cell.
When low, these tests may indicate anemia or excess body fluid. When high, they may show too many red blood cells in the blood or dehydration. These counts are also important to learn the effects of drug treatment or radiation therapy. A blood count helps the doctor know if a drug is working or not. It also helps him or her decide if the amount you are receiving should be changed, or if you need yo try another drug.

Facts About Your Immune System
What is the immune system and what are its components?
The immune system defends the body against harmful germs, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. It is a complex network of:
 Cells (lymphocytes, neutrophils).
 Organs (spleen, thymus, lymph nodes).  Tissues.
The immune system works against germs and diseases in many ways. It tells the difference between healthy cells, germs, and often cancer cells. It can sometimes destroy cancer cells. When immune cells meet other cells that look different or foreign, they launch an attack. Anything that sets off this immune response is called an antigen. At times, the immune system doesnt work correctly. This can happen for many reasons, such as:
 Having received chemotherapy or a transplant.
 Being born with immune disorders or defects.
 Being infected with certain viruses, such as the AIDS virus.
Bone Marrow Transplants
When infants are born with immune disorders or when people have cancer, the immune response doesnt work properly. One possible treatment is a transfer of healthy stem cells. These cells can come from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or cord blood. When these stem cells are transplanted, they can develop into functioning immune cells. This is similar to how the stem of a plant produces leaves and flowers.
In a blood stem cell transplant, a close tissue match is very important. There is a danger that the body will reject the transplanted stem cells. Also, there is a chance that the mature T cells may attack and harm the recipients tissues. This is called graft-versus-host disease. Scientists try to prevent this in a few ways. They can use drugs or antibodies to remove T cells in the transplant. Also, they can use medicines to lower the function of these donor T cells.

Care of Your Central Line (Catheter)
Bandaging
After a central line insertion, you will have two bandages. A small one will be on your neck or chest. It can be removed in two days. Underneath, there are usually Steri- stripsTM. These are paper bandages that will peel off on their own in about one week. After two days, no bandage is needed over that small scar.
The second bandage is lower down and protects your chest where the central line exits the body. Leave this in place. This should be changed only by our nurses or by your parents after our nurses teach them how.
Bathing and Showering
Take only sponge baths at first. Take care to keep the bandages dry. After two days, you can sit the lower half of your body in a tub. You must keep the central line and its bandages dry. Two days after the central line is put in, you may begin taking showers. You can only do this after our nurses have shown you how to cover the central line with plastic wrap.
Never swim or let your central line be under water in a tub. Flushing
When heparin solution is injected into the central line, this is called flushing the line. This should be done twice a week. Our nurses will do this for any patients who are seen in the Pediatric Day Hospital for treatment. Our nurses will train your parents and family members to do the flushing. Once they learn, the flushing can be done at home if no visits for treatment are planned during a given week.
Before flushing, the caps must be thoroughly cleaned with alcohol pads. The caps should only be handled with gloves. Our nurses will train you or your parents and family members to do this.
Common Questions
 Will my central line set off metal detectors? No.
 Can I go in an MRI scanner with a central line?
Yes. The central ine contains no metal and is safe for MRI scanners.
 There is a crack in my central line. What should I do?
Wrap the catheter tightly in gauze or plastic wrap and come to the hospital immediately. If you have an emergency clamp, place it above the crack, along the central line tubing as it travels towards the chest wall. Your surgeon can repair some central line cracks. If a crack occurs, you are at risk for infection. The crack must be taken care of promptly.

What to Bring to the hopsital
Your Memorial Sloan-Kettering physician will tell you which test results and reports to send from your local doctor at home, including x-rays and pathology slides and reports. You may need to sign a release form to obtain these items from your home hospital or doctor's office.
 You will need to bring your Social Security number as well as your medical insurance card. If there are any questions or concerns about coverage or authorizations, your Memorial Sloan-Kettering physician's office can arrange for you to speak with a Patient Financial Services representative before your arrival.
Your Hospital Stay
  Bring a list of any prescription medications that you
may be taking, along with dosages. While staying in the hospital, you will receive your medication from one of the staff.
 Be sure to bring school assignments and school books so that you can continue with ongoing work. This material is also helpful to our New York City Board of Education-certified teachers, who will work with you whether you are hospitalized or in our Day Hospital.
 Comfortable day clothes like sweat pants, large t-shirts, socks and underwear.
 Night clothes like pajamas, a robe, and slippers. A parent staying overnight should also bring a bag, including a change of clothes, personal toiletries and any necessary medicines.
 A favorite blanket, toy, book, video or music, laptop, or iPod (with headphones). Consider bringing pictures of family, friends, and pets.
Please do not bring large amounts of money or any jewelry to the hospital.
Live plants, fresh flowers, pets of any kind, and latex (rubber) balloons are not permitted in our pediatric patients' rooms.

What to Expect on Admission Day
On the day you are admitting to the hospital, you will have your central line placed. Go to the Pediatric Day Hospital. You will be taken to the transplant unit from the recovery room after the central line is placed.
Isolation Precautions
When your white blood cells go below a certain level, or by the day before your blood stem cell transplant, whichever occurs first, you will be placed on reverse isolation precautions to protect you from germs. A card telling visitors about the type of isolation will be placed on the door to your room. The door to your room must remain closed. All staff and visitors who go into your room must wear a mask, wash their hands, and put on gloves. The mask and gloves will be in a box near the sink. You may have visitors every day while you are in the hospital, but they cannot have a cold or any signs of illness. No more than two people should visit at any one time. Your visitors should not eat in your room or use your bathroom. These precautions are in place until you go home from the hospital.
It is not necessary to sterilize things before they are brought into your room. You may bring photos, frames, or a pillow from home to make the room more comfortable. However, space may be limited and you do not want to have clutter in the room. The nurse can help you choose things best suited for isolation.
You may wear a hospital gown, but if you prefer, you may wear your own nightclothes or casual clothing. You may also have stuffed animals that can be laundered and new packaged games. You may not have fresh flowers or plants.
Weight and Vital Signs
You will be weighed each day around 6 am. Most weight changes during transplant hospitalization are due to fluid retention or loss. The inpatient team needs this information by the time they make rounds to make important treatment decisions. Your blood pressure, temperature, pulse, respirations, and blood oxygen level will be checked every four hours around-the-clock. No one likes being awakened at night, but these measurements are important. Any change may require a treatment change.
Exercise and Activity
Once isolation begins, you may not leave your room unless you are going for treatment. However, activity is very important. Get out of bed at least twice a day and try to walk
in your room every day to maintain your muscle tone and strength. Sit up in a chair as often as possible. You can also ask for a stationary bicycle to help keep you active.
Your nurse will assist you with your daily activities if you need help. You may bring a laptop, books, games, etc. to help occupy your time. If you are a student, bring your books and assignments to keep up with schoolwork. In pediatrics, the hospital teacher will come to your room and help you with your lessons.
Your Hospital Stay
39

Eating Well
Because chemotherapy and radiation therapy damage the lining of your stomach, you may not feel well enough to eat anything during part of your hospital stay. To maintain your weight, you may need to receive nutrition through your IV. This is called TPN (total parenteral nutrition). The TPN mixture provides all the nutrients your body needs. Your progress will be checked daily, and changes will be made in the TPN mixture as needed.
Even if you are receiving TPN, you may try to eat and drink if you feel like it. Do not force yourself if you do not feel well. The dietitian and nurse will talk more with you about which foods are best when you are having your treatments.
After your gastrointestinal tract heals, the dietitian can plan a diet for you. It will be based on the Low Microbial Diet booklet that will be given to you before your discharge. Well-cooked, easily digestible foods make eating easier. Do not eat uncooked meats, shellfish, hot dogs, processed meats, unpasteurized dairy products, and aged cheeses. Do not share your food or drinks with anyone. You should not have any take-out foods while you are in the hospital unless they are cooked at home. Ask your nurse, dietitian, or doctor about what kinds of foods your family and friends can bring you.
Mouth Care
Mouth care is an important part of your care in which you can also participate. It must be done at least four times a day or more often if mouth sores appear. You can continue to brush your teeth with an ultrasoft toothbrush. Your nurse will show you how to do mouth care to help keep your mouth clean.

What Happens Before Transplant?
Cytoreductive Therapy
The high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy that physicians use as the first step in an allogeneic transplant has two purposes. This cytoreductive therapy destroys cancer cells as well as cells of your immune system. Unless your immune system is eradicated through this myeloablative therapy (treatment designed to destroy the bone marrow), an allogeneic transplant will be unlikely to take and to reconstitute a new immune system for the patient. Some of the agents commonly used for myeloablation include cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, melphalan, fludarabine, and total body irradiation.
Myeloablative or cytoreductive therapy may last several days or a week or more. A day or two after the completion of treatment, patients generally receive their stem cell transplant.
Total Body Irradiation
Before a hematopoietic blood stem cell transplant (bone marrow, peripheral blood or cord blood transplant), you may receive total body irradiation. If so, the information below will tell you about:
 Why it is needed.
 How it will be planned and given.
 The possible side effects you may have.
Purpose of radiation therapy before transplant
Total body irradiation is given to:
 Destroy cancer cells. Particularly in the areas of the body not easily reached by chemotherapy, such as the brain or testicles (males).
 Decrease the response of your immune system. This is done so that your body will accept the transplanted cells. Unless your donor is an identical twin, your body will see the donor stem cells as foreign. If not suppressed, your immune system will try to destroy these foreign cells. TBI lowers the ability of the immune system to destroy these cells.
 Create space in the bone marrow for the donor stem cell to grow (engraft). Consult
You will meet with radiation oncologists to discuss your treatment. The doctor will talk to you about the best way to administer the radiation. He or she will also tell you about some of the side effects that you may have. Very young children will likely need to have anesthesia for their planning session and treatments. Some older children may need the assistance of a child life specialist from the pediatric day hospital. He or she will help to ease any fears you may have and help you to stay still for the planning sessions. The
Your Hospital Stay
41

Your Hospital Stay
play therapist will come to the planning session and the treatments if needed. Your doctor will discuss this with you during the consult.
Simulation
The next step is the planning session, also called simulation. Sometimes it can be done on the same day as the consult. It usually takes a few hours and you do not need to do anything to prepare for it. Before the simulation, a photograph will be taken of your face. It will be used to identify you during the treatments.
Next, the therapist(s) will help you lie on a table. A CAT scan will be done, which is used for planning the treatment. It is very important for you to be able to stay still during this time. This part of the planning process will not require an intravenous line or any contrast media. If you would like to hear music, please let the therapist know. A CD/DVD can be played during the simulation or you can bring one from home.
X-ray Images
X-ray images will also be taken of your chest. They are taken on the same machine on which you will be treated. For young children getting anesthesia, it will be done during simulations while he or she is asleep.
Skin Markings (Tattoos)
The therapists will draw on your skin with a felt marker that can be washed off after simulation. These marks will be used to make the permanent skin markings called tattoos. To make the tattoos, the therapists will use a sterile needle and a drop of ink. The tattoo marks are no bigger than the head of a pin. The sensation of getting one feels like a pinprick. You will receive two tattoos, one on your upper back and one on your upper chest. They are permanent so you will not need to worry that they will wash off in the shower. If you feel that this will be upsetting, the therapist can use a special cream or spray to numb the skin before the tattoos are placed. Some photographs will be taken of you after you get the tattoos.
Treatment Planning
After your simulation, a team will plan your treatment using your x- ray and CT scan.
The lungs are very sensitive to radiation. They cannot get the same dose that the rest of your body will receive. To protect them, lung blocks will be made. They will decrease the dose of radiation that your lungs receive. The chest x-rays you had are used to make the blocks. These blocks will be placed on a screen in front of your body during each treatment.
The bones in the area of the chest wall located behind these blocks contain a great deal of bone marrow. These areas must receive a full dose of radiation. You will receive radiation to the chest wall, front and back, without the blocks, once a day for two days of your treatment. The images taken of your chest will be used to plan the treatment to your chest wall.
42

Your Hospital Stay
The details from simulation are planned and checked. This takes between five days and two weeks.
Boosts
Extra doses of radiation may be given to specific areas of the body. This is called a boost. Some boosts may be given before you are hospitalized for TBI and transplant. These may be to the:
 Brain, skin, or chest.
Some boosts are given while you are getting TBI. These are to the:
 Chest wall, front and back, without the blocks, once a day for two days of your treatment.
 Testes in male patients who have acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. This is often on the last day. You will be lying down for the treatment with your penis and scrotum exposed. The treatment does not cause any pain or discomfort.
TBI Treatment
Your TBI will be given in divided treatments. The treatment schedule depends on the dose of TBI you will receive.
For most patients:
 Treatments are scheduled three times a day and take about 15-20 minutes each. The treatments are usually given four to six hours apart.
 During treatment, you will be alone in the room, but parents may stand outside the room with the therapists.
 They can see and hear you through an intercom and video screen. For younger children that receive anesthesia:
 TBI treatments are usually given twice a day.
 Your child will not be able to eat or drink for several hours before each treatment
due to this need for anesthesia. The doctor(s) will discuss with you how long the child will need to be nothing by mouth (NPO) before each treatment.
When you receive TBI:
 Wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothes. Clothes should not have any metal. You can keep your socks on, but you must take off your shoes or slippers.
 Do not wear any jewelry or metal objects (rings, hairpins). These may increase the radiation dose to that area.
 You may bring a CD or videotape to play during your treatment. A CD player or VCR is available in the rooms so you dont have to bring one. You can also choose VCRs from the ones we have in playroom. An escort will bring you to your treatments. Parents accompany the escorts and patient.
43

Positioning
You must be in the correct position during treatment. Infants and very small children will be wrapped in a papoose board on a table. Older children are positioned standing on a platform. You will stand over a bicycle-like seat with your hands placed on bars on either side of your hips. A harness will be placed around the body and attached to the frame. This will prevent you from falling (Figure1). The radiation therapists will help you. You will face the machine for the first half of your treatment and will be turned away from it for the second half. The lung blocks are placed on a board that hangs in front of your chest. They do not touch your body. The tattoos you got during simulation will be used to place the blocks. A large Plexiglass screen is placed in the front of your
body before the treatment begins. It assures that the treatment is evenly distributed.
Description of Treatment
Figure 1
Your Hospital Stay
  The radiation therapists will leave the room when you are in
position. Breathe normally, but do not to move during the treatment. If you move, the treatment will not be evenly distributed. You may hear the machine click as it turns on and off, but you will not feel anything. Having a radiation treatment feels like having an x-ray. It is painless. The treatments take about 15 to 20 minutes. Some patients find it helpful to listen to music.
 Although you are alone during your treatment, the radiation therapist will watch you on a TV screen. They can talk to you over an intercom system (Figure 2). They can hear you if you
have any questions or problems during the treatment. If at any point you are not feeling well, tell them.
 The treatment can be stopped to give you a rest.
 The therapist will come into the room to help you.
 Your treatment will be restarted once you are feeling better.
Figure 2
  You and your clothes do not become radioactive during or after treatment. It is safe for you to be around other people.
Side Effects of Treatment
You will not feel any pain during the treatment, but TBI has side effects. Some occur right away or during the four days of treatment. Some occur days or weeks after your treatment. And some occur months after TBI.
44

Your Hospital Stay
During the treatment, the most common side effects include:
 Headache.
 Nausea and vomiting. You will receive medicines to decrease this side effect.
 Diarrhea.
 Fatigue.
 A skin reaction.
 Swelling/pain in the salivary glands. You may have pain in front of the ear and in
the jaw.
Medicines can help decrease nausea and vomiting. These side effects are generally the greatest during the first day of radiation. They usually begin one to two hours after the first treatment. If you have nausea and vomiting, it usually becomes less frequent as the treatment proceeds. It often stops by the third day. You may also have diarrhea during the first few treatment days. Tell your nurse or doctor if you have any symptoms.
During the days of your treatment, you may not use any of the following as they can increase the side effects of the radiation and cause irritation/burning of the skin:
 Lotions.
 Creams.
 Ointment.
 Deodorants.
Some patients develop a mild reddening of the skin during the first few days of treatment. After radiation is completed, your skin may feel dry and itchy. If you received a boost to the testes, the reaction may be more severe in the scrotal area. Your doctor or nurse will let you know when you may use creams/ointments to help your dry skin.
There are a number of side effects you may get during the days and weeks after your TBI. These also may be from the chemotherapy you have received.
All patients develop:
 Low blood counts (bone marrow suppression).  Hair loss.
 Discomfort in the throat and mouth.
Most patients develop:
 Mouth sores.
 Nausea and vomiting.
 Diarrhea.
 Change in taste. This generally returns to normal by approximately three months
after transplant.
These side effects will go away over time.
TBI can cause long-term side effects months or years after your transplant.
45

Your Hospital Stay
 Sterility is an expected side effect. Please talk to your doctor or nurse about any concerns you have.
 About half of the patients will need thyroid supplements.
Other long-term side effects are rare, but can occur. They include:  Inflammation of the sac that surrounds the heart.
 Inflammation of the lungs.
 Cataracts.
 Second malignancies or new cancers.
Your doctor will discuss these with you in detail during your consult.
46

Daily Routine at MSKCC
Vital signs
Your blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, and breathing rate will be checked at least every four hours. In special cases, such as if have a fever or need to get a transfusion, your vital signs will be checked more often. Vital signs help the health care team know how your body is responding to cancer or treatment.
Weight
Your weight will be checked daily, sometimes twice a day. Weight loss may mean that you are not eating or drinking enough. In some cases, you may gain weight from too much fluid. In either case, the health care team needs to know when your weight changes during treatment. The dose of chemotherapy may also change if your weight changes.
Intake
Intake means how much fluid you are taking in (by mouth and by IV).
Output
Output means how much fluid you are putting out (urine, vomit, and, stool). This may be measured every day to keep track of what you drink and how much you put out. For younger patients, parents should not throw the diaper away after changing the child. It will be weighed to see how much urine is in the diaper. Even if the patient uses the urinal or bedpan, the urine should not be flushed until it is measured. Always remember to wear gloves for 48 hours after chemotherapy has been given when you are handling urine, vomit, or stool.
Blood Tests
You will need to have blood tests done during treatment. Blood tests are done so that the test results are ready when the doctors make the plan of care for the day.
Rounds
Each day the health care team meets to discuss your plan of care This meeting is called rounds. The team looks at your blood tests, input/output, and talks about how you are responding to treatment. The team will also come in the morning to examine you and talk about the plan of care. For parents, getting up and dressed before morning rounds is helpful. You want to be ready to talk with the team when they arrive. Write down questions you have before rounds to help you remember what to ask.
Visitors
Parents are permitted at all times. You may have two additional visitors at a time during the hours of 8 am to 8 pm. Children under the age of eleven may not visit without special permission from the head nurse.
Your Hospital Stay
47

What Happens on the Day of Transplant?
Once the chemotherapy and radiation treatments are completed, you will receive the donors stem cells. They are given through your central venous catheter. They will travel through your bloodstream and into your bone marrow spaces where they begin to grow, making healthy blood cells in your body. You will be in the hospital until your new stem cells start to work reasonably well. This takes about four to six weeks from the day of transplant.
T Cell Depleted Blood Stem Cell Transplant
Allogeneic blood stem cell transplants can be unmodified or T cell depleted. A T cell depleted blood stem cell transplant is one in which certain lymphocytes, known as T cells, are removed. Your doctor may decide that this type of transplant is best for you. If you are to have a T cell depleted blood stem cell transplant, you will receive it once the process of removing the T cells is complete. This takes 12-24 hours, so you may receive the transplant either late at night or sometimes, the day after your donor has given the stem cells. The amount of stem cells with this type of transplant is generally small. The doctor will inject them directly into your central venous IV catheter from a large syringe. The nurse will check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen level during this time. There are rarely any side effects.
Unmodified Blood Stem Cell Transplant
In unmodified transplants, the stem cells are given without first taking out the T cells. Red cells or plasma may need to be removed before you receive the stem cells if you and your donor are not the same blood type.
The stem cells are given to you through your IV over several hours. This process is like a blood transfusion. The stem cells are in a bag. They look like a bag of blood. While the stem cells are going into your catheter, the nurse will check your temperature, blood pressure, and pulse, and record your fluid intake and urine output. There are rarely any side effects from the infusion of unmodified blood stem cell transplants.
Unrelated Blood Stem Cell Transplant
After the stem cells are obtained from an unrelated donor, they are immediately brought to Memorial Sloan-Kettering. Here they are processed for an unmodified or a T cell depleted transplant.
Umbilical Cord Blood Transplant
The cord blood cells are stored frozen. On transplant day, they will be thawed in the laboratory and brought to your room in a bag. They will be given through your catheter. Sometimes patients can feel sick to their stomach or get high blood pressure during the cord blood infusion. Your nurse will watch you closely for any side effects and treat them if they occur.
Your doctor and nurse will discuss any questions or concerns you may have about the type of transplant you are going to receive.

Possible Complications after Your Transplant
Some complications are possible after your transplant. Infection, bleeding, and anemia are some of the major ones that can occur while you are waiting for your blood counts to return to normal. In most cases, there are steps that you and your care team can take to prevent, manage, and treat them.
Infection
You will be at risk for bacterial, fungal, and viral infections for several months after transplant. They are a major risk in the early recovery period until your new marrow grows and makes white blood cells to fight infection. Some infections will still be a risk while your immune system recovers during the first two years after your transplant.
Fever is one important sign of infection. If you develop a fever, a chest x-ray will be obtained and urine and blood cultures will be done. You will be given IV antibiotics to help your body fight the infection. Nearly all patients develop fever during the first two weeks after transplantation. Most infections are treated successfully with antibiotics.
Your doctors and nurses will try to prevent you from getting infections. You will likely be given drugs that are used to treat infections. For the transplant patient, they are also used to prevent them. You will receive anti-viral medicines. These help prevent any viral infection you had in the past from coming back after the transplant. Viral infections can include:
- Coldsores.
- Shingles.
- Cytomegalovirus.
- Otherinfectionsaffectingthelungsorgut.
Patients whose immune systems are not working well can get infections that would not occur in healthy people. These are called opportunistic infections. You may need medicine to help protect you from these infections. You will be at risk for them until your white blood cell count and immune system return to normal.
Bleeding
Your platelet count will be low. Since platelets form blood clots, you will be at risk for bleeding. The mucous membranes of the nose, mouth, skin, and gastrointestinal tract are most commonly affected. You will have platelet transfusions if your count falls below 20,000 or if you have any bleeding.
Anemia
When your red blood cell count is low, you may experience weakness and fatigue. Your nurse will assist you with your daily activities if you need help. You will be given red blood cell transfusions as necessary. These and all other blood products will be irradiated to prevent harmful side effects.
Organ Complications
You may have complications in your kidneys, liver, lungs, or heart. These are not common, but they can be serious. You are at higher risk if you already have a medical
Your Hospital Stay
49

Your Hospital Stay
condition in any of these organs. This is why we carefully evaluate your organ functions before the transplant.
Kidneys
Your kidneys filter your blood and make urine to send waste products out of the body. The chemotherapy you get before transplant can affect how well your kidneys work. This is temporary, but waste products may remain in your blood until your kidney function improves. It also means that your kidneys will have more trouble getting rid of any drugs you are given. Your nurses will keep records of the amount of fluid you get. This includes what you drink and what you get through your IV line. They will also write down how much urine you make. This will help the doctors to know if you are beginning to have problems with your kidneys. You will also have blood tests every day to tell your doctors how your kidneys are working. If necessary, the doctors will adjust the doses of any drugs you are getting to decrease the risk to your kidneys.
Liver
Your liver removes harmful substances from your body fluids, absorbs nutrients, and produces bile. Bile helps you digest your food. Side effects on your liver include problems with digestion. A more serious problem is that the liver may no longer remove breakdown products of your body and you will become jaundiced. In some patients, small blood vessels in the liver are injured. This is called veno-occlusive disease or VOD. These vessels can then become blocked so that blood cannot flow. This can cause the liver to become enlarged and may damage liver cells. Fluid may fill the abdomen. Liver problems of this sort usually begin within the first three weeks after transplant. With rare exception, all patients receive a drug that helps to prevent clot formation in the liver. This drug is called heparin, and it is given through your venous catheter. If you have side effects in your liver, your doctor will discuss the treatment options with you in more detail.
Lungs
Your lungs control breathing. Infections that affect the lungs may cause problems with breathing. Two problems that can occur during transplant are:
 An infection of the lungs causing pneumonia and
 Damage of your lungs from chemo and radiation
This most commonly occurs in the first few weeks after transplant and can be serious. You will have regular chest x-rays while you are in the hospital. Your doctors and nurses will watch you closely for any sign of pneumonia. Tell them if you notice any change in your breathing. Do not ignore a cough or shortness of breath. Treatment depends on what causes the pneumonia.
Exercise your lungs. This may help to keep them clear. Your nurse will show you how to do deep breathing. You may also use an incentive spirometer. For this, you inhale deeply through a small tube to force a tiny ball to rise. You will receive different kinds of medicines to prevent or treat lung infections. Your nurse will review your routine with you.

Heart
Your heart pumps blood throughout your body. Certain chemotherapy drugs may have side effects that damage the heart. Your doctors will watch your heart function carefully while you are in the hospital.
Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD)
T cells are white blood cells whose function is to attack foreign cells. They are responsible for starting GVHD. GVHD is an immune response of the T cells in the donor transplant (graft) against the patients (hosts) body. There is a chance that GVHD will develop when the new stem cells begin to engraft or grow. A close match of HLA or tissue type between you and your donor helps lower the risk, but does not eliminate it. Other factors in GVHD are your age and the gender of your donor. Anyone whose donor is not an identical twin receives some type of prevention for GVHD. This prevention would include either removal of the T cells from the transplant that cause GVHD, or drugs to prevent those T cells from causing GVHD. There are pros and cons to each method, and there are reasons that you would receive one or the other. Your doctor will discuss these with you before admission.
There are two kinds of GVHD, acute (early) and chronic (late and longer lasting). Acute and chronic GVHD were defined in the past in large part by their timing relative to the transplant. Now, acute GVHD no longer occurs only within the first three months. That is because we have many treatments for transplant and many sources do donors. It can develop later than that, but usually within the first year. Chronic GVHD usually occurs within the first year, but rarely before the first three months after transplant. It may not occur at all. The symptoms of either may be mild to severe. You may develop acute, but not chronic GVHD. You may develop chronic GVHD without having had acute. You may develop both. You may or may not be free of symptoms between acute and chronic. Most patients develop neither or at least milder forms that do not require ongoing treatment beyond two years.
Symptoms of acute GVHD can affect the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, or all of these organs. A skin rash may appear on parts or all of your body. You may have a yellow skin color (jaundice) and an enlarged liver. You may also have nausea, vomiting, and mild to severe diarrhea.
Chronic GVHD often develops after the first 100 days, and usually within the first year after transplant. Symptoms may include skin rash or dry or thickened skin, loss of appetite and weight, diarrhea, dry mouth and sores in the mouth, dry eyes, hair loss, inflammation of the liver, loss of energy, or increased risk for infections.
GVHD can be mild or severe. It may slow the growth of the bone marrow. This means it will take longer for your immune system to function. It may affect one or more parts of the body. If you have it, your doctor will discuss the treatment plan with you. Mild cases of GVHD may be helpful for patients with active leukemia and lymphoma going into transplant. Return of these diseases is lower in transplant survivors who had mild GVHD. That is because the donor T cells may attack any remaining cancer cells. Doctors are doing more research to learn how to maximize this anti-cancer effect. If your disease

was in complete remission before transplant, you do not need the beneficial effect of GVHD.
Graft Failure or Rejection
The transplanted cells sometimes do not grow up successfully inside your body. Graft rejection means your immune system rejects the new stem cells. The treatments you get before the transplant are aimed at preventing graft rejection. The risk of graft rejection lasts about two to four weeks after transplant. Occasionally, graft failure can be later after your transplant. If it occurs, one option may be to get more stem cells from your donor if they are available. This is called a boost. Your doctor will discuss various treatment options with you if this occurs.
Relapse
A risk for many patients is that their disease can come back. This can happen if the treatments you had before the transplant did not kill all your cancer cells. Your risk is higher if you have your transplant when you are in an advanced stage of disease or are already in relapse. Your doctor will follow you closely to watch for any sign of a return of your disease.
Infection Precautions
Personal Hygiene
Keeping yourself clean is very important. You will follow a shower routine that includes washing your skin daily with Betasept or Dial. Start at your neck and move down your body. Wash your upper body, middle section, legs, and finally, your feet. Pay extra attention to washing under your arms, groin, and perineum since these areas are moist and harbor germs. The perineum is the area between a womans vagina and rectum and a mans penis and rectum. Shampoo your scalp with ordinary shampoo or soap once a day. Tell your nurses if you need help.
Germs are often carried on your hands or on objects that you touch. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap after you urinate or move your bowels. Also, wash your hands before eating.
Keep the skin around your central venous IV catheter clean. The dressing that covers and protects it will be changed once a week unless it gets wet or dirty. To reduce the chance of infection, do not let the IV tubing touch the floor.
Transfusions
Your blood counts will be checked every day. The counts will be below normal until the stem cells start to grow. You may need red blood cell and platelet transfusions. Red blood cell transfusions are usually given when the hemoglobin falls below eight. You will have platelet transfusions when your platelet count falls below 20,000. Your family members may be asked to donate red blood cells, platelets, or both. However, they should not donate blood products for you until after the transplant. The doctors and nurses will tell you more about blood transfusions.
52

Immune Recovery
It may take up to 18 months for your immune system to recover. With some patients, it takes even longer, while some recover in six months. We will do blood tests to see how your immune recovery is progressing. These begin about two to three months after your transplant. The tests will tell us how many T cells you have and how well they are working. You will take medicine to prevent infection until we know your immune system can fight off infections. When that happens, you will most likely be given vaccinations to re-immunize you against some diseases. These vaccines are similar to some of the vaccines you received as a child.
Stress and Anxiety
We know that it can be frightening to have new treatments or to stay in your room for such a long time. Some transplant patients have told us that they feel bored in the room because "there's nothing to do. Others have said, they are "tired of feeling sick" and "can't wait to go home," or they "are anxious and depressed. It is natural to feel like this, and sometimes it helps just to talk about things. Please talk with your nurse, social worker, or doctor about your feelings. Psychiatrists are also available to talk to you and your family. They can advise the transplant team about medicines for your emotions. It is important that we all work together.
We will try to help you feel as comfortable as possible. Please ask your nurse for other support services you may have from staff at the Integrative Medicine Service, music therapy, and art therapy.

Low White Blood Cell Count / Neutropenia
Neutrophils are white blood cells (WBC). They help fight bacterial and fungal infections. Your doctor or nurse has told you that your neutrophil count is low. You should take the precautions described on this card to prevent infection until your neutrophil count returns to normal. You should also be aware of signs of infection to report to your doctor or nurse. Be sure to take your temperature orally as directed by your doctor or nurse.
General Hygiene
 Shower or bathe daily. Wash carefully under your arms, in the rectal and genital areas, and in skin folds.
 Use soap that can kill germs. Look for the words antimicrobial or bacteriostatic. Dial is one example, but there are many.
 Perform mouth care after each meal. Use an ultra-soft toothbrush or toothette and brush and rinse as directed by your doctor or nurse.
 Use antibacterial hand gels such as Purell: - Aftershakinghands.
- Afterdirectcontactwithyoungchildren.
Prevent Infection
 Avoid having visitors to your home who have colds or recent infections.
 Postpone any dental work or any invasive procedure that does not need to be done
immediately. Speak with your doctor or nurse first.
 Do not eat raw meats, raw fish, or raw eggs. Please ask your nurse or dietitian for
literature on The Neutropenic Diet if you have not already received that information.
 Do not share eating or drinking utensils.
 Do not touch animal excreta (e.g., litter boxes, bird cages).
 Do not garden or handle soil compost.
Notify your doctor or nurse if you develop any of the following signs of infection:
 Fever (100.4 F, 38 C or higher)
 Shaking chills
 Unrelieved nausea and vomiting
 Flushed face
 Sweats
 Diarrhea
 Mouth sores
 Cough
 Headache
 New onset of pain
 Irritability
 Pain or burning during urination  A general feeling of tiredness;
especially if accompanied by flu-like symptoms.
If you have any problems or questions, speak with your doctor or nurse. After 5 p.m. and on weekends, call (212) 639-7900 and ask to speak to the doctor covering your service.

Guidelines for Patients with a Low Platelet Count
Platelets are colorless cells that are a part of blood. They are produced in bone marrow, the soft, spongy center in most of our large bones. The main function of platelets is to control bleeding. A normal platelet count is 150,000-400,000 platelets per microliter (mcl) of blood.
If your doctor has told you that you have a low platelet count, it is very important that you take precautions to prevent bleeding. You must also recognize any signs of bleeding so you can report them to your doctor or nurse. Precautions and signs of bleeding are listed below. Your platelet count may be low because of the cancer or its treatment.
Protective measures to avoid bleeding:

Call your doctor if you develop any symptoms of bleeding:
 Excessive bruising.
 A faint red rash on your trunk, arms, and legs.
 Vaginal spotting or heavy menstrual bleeding.
 The appearance of broken blood vessels in the "white of the eye" (sclera).
Steps to be taken if bleeding occurs at home:
1. Apply direct pressure on the bleeding site.
2. After applying pressure, call your MSKCC doctor. If you are unable to reach your
doctor, and bleeding does not stop, go to a local emergency room. 3. Apply ice over the bridge of your nose for nosebleeds.
Call your doctor immediately if you have:
 Black bowel movements, blood in the stool, or rectal bleeding.
 Blood in your urine.
 Headaches that do not get better, blurred vision, dizziness.
 Any bleeding that does not get better (coughing up blood, vomiting blood, nose
bleeds).

Mouth Care for Cancer Patients
What is mucositis?
Mucositis is a term that describes changes in your mouth and throat. Some chemotherapy drugs or radiation therapy to the head and neck may cause these. Mouth changes may begin 3 to 10 days after treatment starts. They usually heal about 3 weeks after treatment ends.
Mucositis may cause the following:
 Redness or swelling of your gums and lining of your mouth.
 Mouth sores on the lining of your mouth, inside your cheeks and lips, or on your
tongue.
 Mouth and throat pain that may cause difficulty swallowing.
Do I need special dental care?
Your doctor may tell you to see a dentist before you start cancer treatment. If you need to see your dentist during your treatment, ask him or her to call your cancer doctor first.
How should I care for my mouth?
Brush your teeth and tongue gently after each meal and at bedtime. Use a small, soft- bristle toothbrush. If your mouth is too sore for a regular soft toothbrush, you can get a supersoft one. Some examples of these are:
 BioteneTM Supersoft Toothbrush.
 Sensodyne Total Care.
 Colgate Sensitive Extra Soft Compact Head.
 Oral-B Sensitive Extra Soft Compact Toothbrush #35.
 Use a fluoride toothpaste or baking soda with fluoride.
Floss your teeth with unwaxed dental floss once daily at bedtime. If you have not flossed regularly before treatment, do not start flossing now.
Use one of the following rinses unless your nurse has told you to irrigate your mouth.
Rinse your mouth every four to six hours or more often for comfort. Swish and gargle well for 15-30 seconds, then spit it out.
 One quart (4 cups) of water mixed with one teaspoon of salt and one teaspoon of baking soda. This is the same as one quart of normal saline mixed with one teaspoon of bicarbonate.
 One quart of water mixed with one teaspoon of salt.
 One quart of water mixed with one teaspoon of baking soda.
 Water.
 A mouthwash free of alcohol and sugar, e.g., BioteneTM, DentekTM, BetacellTM
Your Hospital Stay
57

Your Hospital Stay
Use a lip moisturizer (e.g., Aquaphor, A&D ointment TM) after mouth care.
Oral Hygiene
Take good care of your mouth throughout your hospitalization. Good mouth care can help prevent infections and other complications in your mouth. The nurse will work with you to plan your mouth care routine. Below are some of the guidelines to follow.
 You will be given a mouthwash to rinse your mouth before and after meals and at bedtime. You may need to rinse or use mouth sprays every two hours if you develop mouth sores.
 Use only the mouthwash your nurse gives you. Do not use a commercial mouthwash or toothpaste because these products irritate and dry the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat.
 When your platelet count is low, you may bleed easily. Use extra caution when brushing your teeth, and always use an ultra-soft toothbrush.
 Do not use dental floss.
 Avoid licking your lips. This increases drying and chapping.
 To keep your lips moist, apply a lubricant after mouth care and every two to four
hours as needed.
 If your mouth becomes sensitive, avoid hot, spicy, acidic, or coarse foods. You may
prefer soft or liquid food served chilled or at room temperature.
 Tell your nurse if you have any tenderness, discomfort, or pain in your mouth. If your mouth becomes painful, your doctor will prescribe medicine to decrease the pain.
Should I avoid anything?
Avoid:
 Commercial mouthwash that has alcohol (e.g., ScopeTM, ListerineTM)
 Spices (e.g., pepper, chili powder, horseradish, curry powder, Tabasco sauce)  Citrus fruits and juices (e.g., orange, lemon, lime, grapefruit, pineapple)
 Tomatoes
 Hard, dry, or coarse foods (e.g., toast, crackers, raw vegetables, potato chips,
pretzels)
 Very hot or cold foods and liquids
What if my mouth feels painful?
Tell your doctor or nurse. If you have just a few small, painful areas, your doctor may prescribe a topical anesthetic. An example of this is viscous lidocaine 2%. You can apply it to the painful areas using a swab or Q-tips. Apply it every hour as needed.
If you feel pain in most of your mouth and throat, your doctor may prescribe medicine to coat your whole mouth (such as GelClair or viscous lidocaine 2%). Swish, gargle, and spit 1 tablespoon every three to four hours, up to eight times a day. DO NOT SWALLOW IT. Do not eat for one hour afterward.
58

Your Hospital Stay
If you still have mouth pain, tell your doctor or nurse. He or she can prescribe other pain medications.
What if I have trouble swallowing?
These changes will make swallowing easier and help you take in enough protein and calories:
 If your mouth is dry, rinse it just before eating to moisten it and stimulate your taste
buds.
 Eat soft, moist, bland foods in small bites and chew it well.
 Use sauces and gravies.
 Moisten foods with yogurt, milk, soy milk, or water.
 Dip dry foods in liquids.
 Blend or puree your food.
 Alter the temperature and consistency of your food as needed.
 Avoid irritants such as alcoholic beverages, tart or acidic fruits and juices, spicy
foods, pickled foods, and tobacco.
 Sip plenty of water throughout the day to be sure you have enough liquids. Keep in
mind that drinks with sugar (juice, iced tea, soda) may cause tooth decay. You may drink these during meals, but limit them between meals.
What if I do not eat enough?
 Drink supplements such as Carnation Instant Breakfast and EnsureTM.
 Add protein powders to broth, soups, cereals, and beverages. Dilute as needed.
 Eat multiple smalls rather than fewer large meals.
 Tell your doctor and nurse if you do not eat well. They may arrange for you to see a
nutritionist.
What should I do if my mouth is dry?
Drink sips of water often throughout the day. These may also help:
 A spray bottle to squirt water into your mouth
 Commercial mouth moisturizers, e.g., BioteneTM Oral Balance, Salivart, MouthKote  Artificial saliva
 Biotene Gum
 A humidifier
What should I report to my doctor or nurse?
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have:
 New redness, sores, or white patches in your mouth  Bleeding of your gums or mouth
 Difficulty or pain when you swallow
 Pain that does not get better with pain medicine
 A fever of 100.4 F (38C) or higher
 Any questions or concerns

Returning Home After Your Allogeneic Transplant
Introduction
The time frames given below are estimates and may vary. Your doctor will give you time frames that are more exact. Your healthcare team will work with you before you go home to make plans for your follow-up care.
Before you leave the hospital, you should order a Medic Alert bracelet. It should be engraved with the statement "irradiated blood products only." This will let staff in any hospital know what to do if you are in an accident and cannot tell them yourself. It can save your life, and it is just as important as wearing a seat belt in a car. Your nurse will give you an order form.
Going Home
You may be very happy and feel ready to go home. However, you may also have some worries. These worries are common among patients who have had a transplant. The doctors and nurses in the hospital were right there to answer questions and take care of you. At home, you and your family will be doing a lot of the things the nurses and doctors were doing in the hospital. Feeling confident and comfortable doing this is a process that takes time.
This is a time for getting well. You will not feel the same way you did before your illness. Many patients feel tired and weak when they first get home. Your appetite may not be what it once was. It will take time for you to regain your strength and to be able to take part in the activities you enjoyed before your transplant.
The social worker, nurses, and doctors will meet with you during outpatient appointments. Your social worker can help you get the services you need and can give you emotional support. Psychiatry is also available to help you.
Recognizing and Preventing Potential Medical Problems
Infections
It generally takes at least 6 to 12 months for your immune system to develop again. During that time, you are at risk for some infections. The transplant team will be checking your blood to see how well your immune system is working. This will help them advise you about any changes to the isolation guidelines you are asked to follow. This will include when you can go back to school and work.
Although your new immune system will eventually be able to protect you against most infections, even people who have not had a transplant get infections. Because your immune system will not be fully functioning in the first 6-12 months after transplant, an infection could be more serious for you than for others. It is important to be aware of the symptoms listed on the next page.
After Your Transplant
60

Call your doctor or nurse right away if you have:  A fever of 100.4 F (38 C) or higher.
- Call your doctor immediately. It does not matter if its day or night. Doctors and nurses are available 24 hours a day,7 days a week. You will be given numbers to call if you have a fever or any other of the symptoms below.
- Do not take Tylenol, until after you have called your doctor and are told to do so. - You do not have to take your temperature each day. If you do not feel well
however, check it regularly.
You should call your doctor/nurse/nurse practitioner for any of the following:
 Flushed appearance of the skin, sweating, or shaking chills.
 Coughing, sneezing, runny nose, shortness of breath, or chest discomfort.
 Redness, swelling, and/or pain in your throat or eyes.
 A skin rash anywhere on your body. It can be redness, pimples, or blisters.
 Severe pain in your stomach.
 Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Diarrhea is frequent stools (bowel movements) or
stools that are loose or watery.
 Blurred vision or other changes in your eyesight.
 Frequent urination, burning on urination, or both.
 Redness, tenderness, swelling, drainage, or all of these at the exit site of your IV
catheter.
 Difficulty flushing your central venous catheter, or any chills associated with flushing
the catheter.
 Rectal irritation, burning, or pain.
You can catch viruses more easily until your immune system is back to normal. Viruses that you have had in the past can also sometimes develop again (reactivate). One virus in particular is the one that causes chicken pox and shingles. If you are around someone with a viral illness (such as chickenpox, shingles), call your transplant doctor or nurse as soon as you are aware of your exposure. You will need to be assessed.
The virus that causes chickenpox can reactivate in patients who have already had chicken pox. This often starts as pain in the skin with pimple-like blisters. The blisters can be tiny, or as large as an eraser (see photos below). Call your doctor or nurse immediately so you can be treated. Your doctor will need to see you in an isolation room away from other patients. This is because you could infect other patients who have low immune systems.
Shingles Chicken Pox

After Your Transplant
There are some general precautions to decrease your risk of infection. Some guidelines for you to follow are listed over the next few pages.
Personal Hygiene
Personal hygiene is important. It can help prevent an infection.
 Take a daily bath or shower. Use a mild soap such as Dove, Lubriderm, or Basis soap. Do not use Ivory soap or a deodorant soap, as they are very drying. Be sure to wash your underarms and groin. Use a washcloth and towel that are only for your personal use. If you still have an IV catheter, do not allow it to soak in water while you bathe.
 If your skin is dry, you may apply baby oil or a skin moisturizer like Lubriderm. Put it on after your bath while your skin is still damp. Avoid very hot water, and do not rub your skin completely dry with your towel. Do not use lotions containing alcohol. They will increase dryness.
 Hair growth usually begins about three months after transplant. Keep your hair and scalp clean and avoid overly drying shampoos.
 Whenever you are in the sun, protect your skin with sunscreen that has an SPF of at least 30.
 You may use contact lenses. However, be sure that they are thoroughly clean before you wear them. Do not reuse cleaning solutions. Pay attention to expiration dates for cleaning solutions. Throw them away when they have expired.
 You may wear make-up. Use all fresh products after the transplant.
 You can also expect that with new cell growth, new nails will grow and replace
your old nails. This will happen gradually. As with your hair, it will occur over three to four months after transplant.
Oral Hygiene
You can brush your teeth with an ultrasoft toothbrush if your:
 Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is greater than 500 (sometimes called 0.5).
 Platelet count is 20,000 (20) or higher.
Ask your doctor or the Dental Service at MSKCC when you can floss and brush your
teeth with a regular toothbrush.
Dryness of the mouth is another symptom you may have for three to four months or longer. It is an after-effect of the mouth sores you may have had during transplant. Do not use commercial mouthwashes or hydrogen peroxide. They will dry and irritate your mouth. Instead, use a mild salt water rinse. Make it by mixing 12-teaspoon of salt and 12- teaspoon of baking soda in an eight-ounce glass of water. The dentist may prescribe other rinses. Sucking on sugarless candy or lozenges may also be helpful.
Use a fluoride-based mouthwash (e.g., Biotene) after your mouth has fully recovered and is no longer very dry. Allow this mouthwash to sit in your mouth for at least one minute, then spit it out; do not rinse. Dry mouth due to lack of normal saliva increases your risk of cavities. Careful mouth care as explained above will lower that risk.
62

Care of Your Central line Catheter
It is just as important to keep your catheter clean after you go home as it was while you were in the hospital. Your nurse will teach you how to care for it at home and you will have a chance to practice with the nurse watching. You will also get a booklet to remind you of the steps if you forget.
Your Home Environment
Your home should be kept as free of dirt and dust as possible. However, you should not go to extremes. Do not repaint your walls or put down new carpets. In fact, you should not be around any renovations or construction. This includes those in process and those done within the past three months. Stay out of any musty area where mold may grow, such as a damp basement. You may use an air filtration system in your home, but it is not necessary. Do not use a humidifier. Bacteria and mold easily grow in these. A pan of water, placed near a heat source may be of some help in the winter. You must change the water every day.
Your bathroom should be kept very clean (especially the tub and toilet). Use a disinfectant regularly.
To prevent the transfer of germs from others to you, do not share eating utensils or linens. Your eating utensils and linens do not need to be washed separately from the rest of your household. Thoroughly wash all forks, spoons, and knives with water and dishwashing detergent or use the dishwasher. Wash towels twice a week and bed linens once a week. Use only your own towels and washcloths, not those of your family members.
Household plants may remain in your home. However, follow the guidelines below for the first few months.
 Do not touch the soil from household plants unless you wear gloves and a mask.
 Do not touch the water in a vase of flowers unless you thoroughly wash your hands
afterwards. Someone should change the water in the vases daily.
Pets
Animals can carry diseases. They may put you at greater risk while your immune system recovers. You may touch your pet and keep a house pet in your home, but it is best that you do not have close physical contact. Do not touch the animal's saliva or feces. Be sure to protect yourself from bites or scratches. Do not handle or care for birds, lizards, snakes, turtles, hamsters, or other rodents while you recover. If you must clean a fish tank, protect yourself. Use gloves when you clean the tank. If you have a cat or dog at home, follow the additional guidelines below until your doctor instructs you otherwise.
 Be sure that your pet is up-to-date with immunizations and any booster shots.
 Have your veterinarian check your pet's stool yearly for parasites.
 If you have a cat, get it tested each year for feline leukemia (viral infection) and for
toxoplasmosis (a common parasite infection that cats carry).
After Your Transplant
63

After Your Transplant
 Have your pet treated for fleas. If your pet walks through wooded areas, have it screened for ticks every day during tick season (May to November).
 Do not clean cat litter boxes or clean up after your dog in the street. Have someone else do these things for you.
 Keep your pets indoors or on your own property. This helps to prevent them from picking up diseases from other animals.
 Do not allow pets in your bed.
If you plan to get a pet after your transplant, it is best that you select a healthy dog or cat that is more than one year old. Have it spayed or neutered. Outside of your home, avoid close contact with animals in a farm or a petting zoo. Consult with your doctor before you resume or start activities such as hunting with your pet.
Family and Visitors
You may have close physical contact with those in your immediate family. Do not have close contact with someone who has a cold or any signs of being sick. Wear a mask if you absolutely must be in the same room with someone who has a cold or is sick. Your family members and close friends should have a yearly flu shot to protect them from the flu, which is contagious to you.
You may have visitors, but limit them to small groups. Do not visit with anyone who has:
 A cold.
 Chickenpox.
 Recently been exposed to chickenpox.
 Recently been exposed to shingles.
 Recently been exposed to herpes simplex, a virus that causes cold sores or fever
blisters.
 Recently been exposed to any other type of virus or infection.
 Recently received a live virus. There are very few of these, but if someone in your
household needs one, his or her doctor should be told that you are immune suppressed and live in the same household. Some examples of live viral vaccines include the following:
- Livepoliovaccine
- Liveinfluenzavaccine(vaccinesprayedintothenose)
- Rotavirusvaccine(giventobabiestoprotectthemagainstavirusthatcauses
vomiting and diarrhea)
- Livechickenpox(Varivax)orShingles(zostavax) - Measles,mumps,rubellavaccine
Call your doctor immediately if you or any other family member is exposed to chickenpox, "shingles," measles, German measles (rubella), or mumps.
Outside Your Home
Take regular walks outside, but avoid dirty areas and construction sites. Walking is an excellent way to regain your strength and endurance. During the first few months after your transplant, try to avoid places like:
64

 Supermarkets.
 Shopping malls.
 Movie theaters.
 Schools.
 Restaurants.
 Public transportation.
Ask your transplant health care provider if you may go to some of these places at off- peak hours, when there are fewer people. You should not take buses or subways for at least three months after transplant. Your doctor will advise you as to when some or all of these restrictions can be lifted.
Your skin is more sensitive because of the treatment you have received. The medicines you are taking may add to this. Limit your time in direct sunlight. Your skin may have a tendency to sunburn more easily. If you will be in direct sunlight for 20 minutes or more, you should cover your skin with cotton clothing and a protective hat. Use a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more. Prolonged exposure to the sun may also reactivate cold sores or fever blisters caused by a virus (called herpes simplex virus).
You may not swim if you have a central line. If you do not have a central line, you may swim in the ocean after you regain your strength and are more active. Your transplant doctor will tell you when it is okay. Once you have been given permission to swim, pay attention to any pool or ocean alerts from the health department. Do not swim if the water has a high bacteria count. Make sure pool water is chlorinated. You may not swim in lakes, rivers, or crowded pools until you your immune system has recovered. Use common sense. Avoid obviously polluted, outdoor bodies of water.
Bleeding
Platelets are blood cells that help form clots and control bleeding. When your platelet count is low, bleeding is a potential problem. Many patients leave the hospital with a low platelet count. It may take weeks or months for the new marrow to produce normal numbers of platelets.
Signs of a low platelet count include changes in the skin, bleeding, or both. Skin changes may include a lot of bruising or petechiae (pe-tea-key-eye). These tiny, purplish-red spots on the skin do not disappear when you press them. You may see them on your lower legs or inside ankles after you leave the hospital. If you see many petechiae, call your doctor. Other symptoms of a low platelet count might include bleeding from your gums or nose. If you need them, you can have platelet transfusions as an outpatient.
Our primary concern is a change in any of these signs or symptoms. If you went home with any of these symptoms and they have increased in amount or frequency, let your doctor know. If you have not had any of these symptoms, but suddenly develop them, call your doctor. It may mean that there is a change in your platelet count.
After Your Transplant
65

After Your Transplant
If you have an injury that causes bleeding, do not be frightened. Remain calm and follow first aid principles for the type of injury.
 Open wounds: If you cut yourself, put a clean dry gauze pad, towel, or cloth over
the cut, and press it firmly. Apply pressure until the bleeding stops. If the bleeding continues, elevate the wound. For example, raise your arm or prop up your feet. Apply ice to the wound, and notify your doctor.
 Nosebleeds: If you have a nosebleed, sit up and lean slightly forward. Do not tilt your head back. Squeeze the bridge of your nose between your thumb and forefinger for at least 10 minutes without letting go. This time is needed because that is how longs it takes the blood to clot. If the bleeding persists, continue to squeeze your nose. Apply a small bag of ice to the bridge of your nose until the bleeding stops. If the bleeding continues longer than a half hour, notify your doctor.
 Accidents: If you are in an accident, you may need blood or blood products. They must be irradiated to 3,000 rads. Wear your MedicAlert emblem at all times. It gives the doctor this information. That is to prevent transfused blood from causing graft- versus-host disease (GVHD). Read about GVHD below. If you are admitted to another hospital, have the doctor call MSKCC immediately for guidance on blood products.
If your platelet count is below 50,000 (50K):
 Use a soft-bristle toothbrush or an oral irrigator such as a WaterPic to prevent gum bleeding.
 Do not take aspirin, products that have aspirin, and aspirin-like medicines (also see "Common Drugs to Avoid).
 Avoid blowing your nose forcefully.
 If you are constipated, call your doctor. You may need more fiber in your diet or a
stool softener.
 Avoid activities or sports that can cause injury. If you have any doubts, discuss it with
your doctor.
Graft versus Host disease (GVHD)
When your new donor marrow begins to "take" or grow, there is a chance that GVHD will develop. GVHD is an immune response caused by the donor cells (graft) against the patient's (host's) body. The chance of developing GVHD depends on the type of transplant. Anyone who is at risk for GVHD will receive medicine to try to prevent it. No preventive measure is perfect, however. You should learn the symptoms of GVHD. It is important to tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you have any GVHD symptoms. That way, you can be evaluated and if needed, treated early. The symptoms may be mild or severe and can develop within one year or so after your blood stem cell transplant.
Patients can develop acute GVHD only, chronic GVHD only, or both acute followed by chronic GVHD. GVHD sometimes has a delayed onset and may not appear until after the first 100 days. Any of the following organs may be involved in acute GVHD:
66

After Your Transplant
Organ
        Symptoms
     Skin
     A rash on parts or all of your body. It may worsen to the point where the skin blisters or peels.
   G.I. (gastrointestinal) Tract
   Occasional or persistent loss of appetite
 Mild to severe upset stomach
 Nausea and vomiting
 Diarrhea, with or without bleeding, but usually with
stomach cramps
 Liver
      Mild, moderate, or severe liver function changes may be seen in blood tests. These can cause:
- Yellowingoftheskinandeye(jaundice).
- Changesinthecoloroftheurineorstool.
- Enlargementoftheliver.
      Bone marrow and immune system
       Long periods of low platelet and white blood cell counts. Treatment can take a long time to show improvement.
   Call your doctor or nurse if you notice any of the following symptoms:
 Any rash or itching, even if it only is redness on the palms of your hands or the soles of your feet.
 Skin or eyes that appear yellow.
 Urine that becomes dark in color (tea or punch colored, brown, or obviously
bloody).
 Stools that are:
- Watery,frequent,and/orlargeinvolume. - Blackortarry.
- Bloody
- Green,white,orclaycolor.
- Associatedwithcrampyoranytypeofbellypain. - Associatedwithnausea,vomiting,orboth.
Chronic GVHD develops later than acute GVHD. It may also involve the same organs as acute GVHD, but it can involve other organs as well. The symptoms with chronic GVHD may range from mild to severe. Call your transplant doctor if you develop:
 Thickening and unusual dryness or scaling of the skin.
 Loss of appetite or weight loss.
 Dryness of your mouth or eyes.
 New onset of breathing problems like wheezing.
These could be early signs of chronic GVHD. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment plan for you.
67

After Your Transplant
The transplant team will review your treatment plan with you regularly. Treatment for chronic GVHD may be needed for months. In some cases, viral infections may cause GVHD to come back. Viruses can also make the GVHD worse, even after transplant. Call your doctor if any of your symptoms get worse or if new ones develop. You will need to be treated.
Resuming your activities
Daily Activities
Recovery after a transplant varies. Most patients find that it takes about three months to feel almost normal again. Some patients take longer. The time after your transplant is a time of cell recovery and growth. Your bone marrow will grow. The cells in your mouth, stomach, intestine, hair, and muscles will all regrow. This requires calories and energy. You may feel more tired than you expected. Remember, this fatigue and weakness is not unusual. Each week you should regain more of your strength.
Around the third month after transplant, your hair will start growing more quickly. You may feel well enough to start resuming your old level of activity.
From this point on, you will probably feel progressively better. For most people, however, the first six months to one year after transplant remain a time of recovery.
Hobbies
Some hobbies like wood working, painting, and model building use products that can be toxic. Always work in a room with plenty of fresh air. Keep windows open. Use non- toxic paints and glue.
Returning To School
The earliest you might return to school is about two to four months from the time of the transplant. Some people may feel ready to return very quickly. Others feel concerned after being away for so long. It may help to begin slowly. For example, a schedule of half days or three days a week may be a good start. Most patients tell us that thinking about returning is almost harder than the actual event.
Making the transition back to your usual lifestyle can be difficult. Some patients have talked about feelings related to changes in their appearance. Hair loss is very hard for many. Others have trouble concentrating or maintaining their attention span. Many cannot keep up their former pace. The MSKCC staff is here to talk with you about going back to school. You may speak to a social worker, nurse, psychiatrist, or your doctor. We can work with you to find ways to ease your transition.
68

Follow-up care
Outpatient Visits and Follow-Up
Follow-up visits are for check-ups and these will be scheduled before you go home. They also give you and your doctor a chance to talk about your progress. They are a time for you to ask questions. In general, you will be seen at least once a week for the first three months after transplant. After that, your appointments will be further apart as long as you are doing well. Some patients find it helpful to bring a list of questions that may have come up since the last visit.
Bring either a list of all of your medicines and doses or all of your medicine bottles. Your medicine list will be reviewed and updated at each visit. Always check your medicines before each appointment. Make a list of the ones that need refills. Your doctor or nurse will give you the prescriptions during your visit.
Try to call the week before your medicines are about to run out. Also, try to avoid calling Friday afternoon right before the weekend. Many pharmacies are closed at night or may not have the medicine in stock that you need. For the same reason, try not to wait until the weekend to call for refills.
During your follow-up visits, blood will be drawn. The blood tests are to check your blood counts, your electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium, calcium levels), and liver and kidney function. Blood tests will be done from time to time to monitor your immune system recovery. Bone marrow aspirations will be done every few months. They are usually done at 1, 3, 6, 12 months after your transplant. If needed, your bone marrow may be checked more often or for a longer time after transplant. Bone marrow tests tell us about the health and growth of your marrow.
If you had a transplant for acute leukemia, you may need spinal taps (lumbar punctures). This is especially true for patients who have had leukemia in the spinal fluid. It is also true for patients who are at high risk for this. The lumbar puncture allows your doctor to give you more chemotherapy in your spinal fluid after transplant. It can also be given through an Ommaya reservoir if you have one. In children, this is generally done under short term general anesthesia.
If you require intravenous treatments, your doctor or nurse will tell you:
 Why you need them.
 How long you will need them.
 How often you will need them.
If you need any, they will be given in the adult or pediatric day hospital. The appointments will usually be scheduled with your follow-up visits.
After Your Transplant
 69

After Your Transplant
Ongoing follow up care after transplant is very important to make sure you achieve the best possible long term health. At some point after your transplant, you may be referred to our survivorship nurse practitioner. The aim of this nurse practitioner is to assist your general recovery and manage the effects of cancer treatment and transplant. The survivorship nurse practitioner is part of the transplant team and works closely with your attending and nurses to ensure your recovery. The nurse practitioner will also communicate directly with your primary care provider so that information about your transplant is included in your overall health care.
Dental Follow-up
Have your local dentist work on your teeth for routine checks. If you need extensive dental work, have your local dentist consult one of our dentists. He or she should call (212) 639-7644 before treating you. Your transplant doctor will tell you when its safe to resume all dental care with your dentist.
Transplant before age 11 can delay dental root development. Your local dentist or orthodontist should speak with our dentist before treating you. Your treatment plan may have to be changed.
Eye Exams
You may develop cataracts if you received:  Radiation.
 High-dose steroids.
If you develop symptoms, see an eye doctor. You may only need a change in your eyeglass or contact lens prescription. Be sure to tell the optician or eye doctor what treatment you had.
Endocrine (Hormonal System)
Your hormonal system may not return to normal. You will have blood work and exams to check your hormone levels. You may have a change in your thyroid function. If so, it will require medicine to keep your thyroid function healthy.
Immunizations
All transplant patients get some immunizations once their immune system has matured enough. You will need most of the ones you may have already received. You will receive specific instructions for these when it is safe to begin as well as the schedule they should be given. No live viral vaccines are given until two years after transplant. At that time, they are only given if the patient is off any medicines that can lower the immune system (steroids, other medicines to treat graft versus host disease). To learn more about vaccines in general you can go to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Website at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis.
70

Travel following transplant
Travel, particularly to foreign countries, should be discussed with your transplant care providers. Travel to certain countries or continents may require certain immunizations or medicines to prevent infection such as travelers diarrhea or malaria. Please let your transplant doctor know if you are planning any trips outside the country even if you are more than a year following your transplant. Since many countries have infections that are not common in the United States, you may need to be seen by a travel medicine specialist. General information for infection prevention for travelers can be obtained at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel.

Outpatient Journal
Please complete the outpatient journal on your child. The information is very useful to us to follow your child's progress. The journal aids us in identifying areas of concern. Upon returning home, please continue to complete the journal. These can be useful to your local doctor as well.
Temperature: Take and record your child' temperature each day and additionally if your child feels warm. Call if temp is > 38C.
Central line site: Note any drainage, redness, swelling or tenderness at exit site or along the tract. Call if your child experiences chills or fever after flushing the central line.
Sleep: Record how well your child slept (fair, poor, okay, great or number of hours, times awake).
Appetite/nausea/vomiting/diarrhea: Note any changes in appetite, any nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.
Oral care: Note any changes in the oral mucosa such as bleeding, white patches, dryness, etc.
Skin: Record any changes in skin especially rashes, bruising and location (face, chest). Urine: Note any blood in urine, pain or discomfort with urination, decrease in urine
output.

After Your Transplant
When to Call the Doctor
If you have worried about knowing when to call the doctor, you are not alone. Parents want to watch closely for any sign that their child may need to see the doctor but may not be sure what those signs are. They also may worry about "bothering" the doctor or treatment team. Please call about any problems your child may be having. If you are unsure, this list can be used as a guide.
Call the Doctor If Your Child Has Any of the Following:
1. A fever. (100.4F or 38C)
2. Chills even without a fever.
3. A cough.
4. Vomiting or diarrhea.
5. A Rash.
6. A decrease in urine output.
7. Unable to take his or her medicines.
8. Bleeding.
9. Redness or oozing around the central line, or if the central line is dislodged.
10. Pain
Call 911 or Emergency Services
If you are having an emergency, you should call 911 before you do anything else.

Side Effects from Chemotherapy
Medication Guide
Some people receive several chemotherapy drugs instead of chemotherapy and radiation. Your doctor will tell you which drugs you will get. Your binder has a fact card on each drug (See Medication Guide). The fact card describes the short- and long- term side effects. Some general side effects are listed below.
Bone Marrow Suppression
Radiation and chemotherapy treatments kill both leukemia cells and normal cells in your bone marrow. Because the bone marrow produces your blood cells, your blood counts will be very low until the donors marrow begins to work. While your blood counts are low, special measures will be used to protect you from infection and bleeding.
Gastrointestinal Tract Symptoms
Radiation and chemotherapy can make you feel sick when they are given. They also destroy normal cells lining the mouth and intestines. This may cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea during and after the treatments. You may also develop painful sores in your mouth and mild to severe pain in your throat and lower esophagus. These are temporary. You will be given anti-nausea and pain medicine when you need it. As your white blood cell count starts to increase, your mouth and throat will start to heal.
Hair Loss
You will temporarily lose hair on your body and scalp. This begins about seven to ten days after you have finished your treatment. Until your hair grows back, it may help to wear a scarf, wig, or hat. Your hair will start to grow back beginning about three months after the transplant. The color or texture of your hair may change when it grows back.
Difficulty with Concentration
Some people tell us they have trouble concentrating after transplant. They complain that their attention span is short. Math may become difficult. This often improves over time, but some patients will not return to the same level they had before transplant. Children may require testing every year or so after the transplant. The results will help your doctor make suggestions to your school.
Hemorrhagic Cystitis
Certain drugs, such as Cytoxan, can irritate the lining of the bladder. This may cause blood in the urine and painful urination. To help prevent this, you will receive large amounts of IV fluids, which will make you urinate often. Try to urinate at least every one to two hours on the days you receive Cytoxan. Your urine will be measured and checked for blood.
Coping with Side Effects
We cannot predict which of the above side effects you will have or how severe they will be. You may feel some of them just a little, or you may feel some of them a lot. Because of your treatments, there may be days when you feel very sick. We can give you medicine to try to help you feel better, so it is important to tell us how you are feeling.

Directions for Giving an Injection with Neupogen (Filgrastim) or Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) in a Pre-Filled Syringe
Name of medicine ____________________________________________ Medication schedule
Dose and amount
Equipment
 Pre-filled syringe with plastic needle guard attached  Alcohol pads
 Disposable sharps container
 2 X 2 gauze pad or cotton ball
Other
A subcutaneous injection gives medicine below the skin through a needle. A pre-filled syringe has the medicine already in it. You will practice this with your nurse. When you are at home and on your own, use this sheet the first few times you give yourself the injection. If a family member or friend will give you the injections, share this information with that person.
Storing Neupogen or Neulasta
 Both medicines should be stored in the refrigerator, but not in the freezer. If the medicine is frozen by accident, allow it to thaw in the refrigerator. If it is frozen a second time, do not use it. Call your doctor or nurse for further instructions.
 The medicine can be left out at room temperature for up to 24 hours. Do not leave it in direct sunlight. If you have any questions about how to store or carry it when you travel, call your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist.
Prepare to Give the Injection
1. Prepare a clean area on which to work, such as a kitchen table.
2. Remove the prefilled syringe from the refrigerator. Allow it to reach room
temperature. This takes about 30 minutes.
3. Do not shake the prefilled syringe. Shaking may damage the Neupogen. If it has
been shaken, the solution may appear foamy and it should not be used.
4. Check to make sure the name Neupogen or Neulasta appears on the package or
syringe label.
5. Check to make sure the expiration date on the syringe has not passed. If the date
has passed, discard the syringe.
6. Check to make sure the strength is the same as your doctor prescribed. The
strength is listed in the colored dot on the package.
7. Check to make sure the liquid in the syringe is clear and colorless. Do not use it if it
looks discolored or cloudy, or if it has crystals in it. 8. Gather the materials you will need.
   80

9. Wash your hands well with soap and water.
Choose an Injection site
1. Choose an injection site from the recommended areas. (Figure 1)
 The outer area of your upper arms
 The abdomen, except for the two inch area around your navel
 The front of your middle thighs
 The upper outer areas of your buttocks
2. Expose the area by removing or folding back any clothing that covers it. Keep track of which site was used last and rotate the sites. Choosing a new site can help avoid soreness at any one site. Do not inject into an area that is tender, red, bruised, or hard. Do not inject into an area that has scars or stretch marks.
3. Tear off any three edges on a sealed alcohol pad. Hold the packet at an edge you did not tear. Carefully open the packet to expose the alcohol pad but do not take it out. Set the open packet on your work area. You will use this alcohol pad to clean the skin at the site just before you inject the medicine.
Giving the injection
1. Remove the syringe from the package and the tray. Make sure that the needle guard is covering the barrel of the glass syringe. Do not push the needle guard over the needle cover before injection. (Figure 2) If the needle guard is covering the needle, that means it has been activated. Do not use that syringe. Dispose of that syringe in the sharps container. Use a new syringe from the package.
2. Hold the syringe through the needle guard windows. Hold it with the needle pointing up. This helps prevent medicine from leaking out of the needle.
3. Carefully pull the needle cover straight off.
4. Do not let anything, including your fingers, touch the needle. If anything touches the needle, it must be discarded in the sharps container. Start the process again with a new pre-filled syringe.
5. Check the syringe for air bubbles. If there are air bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your fingers until the air bubbles rise to the top. Slowly push the plunger up to force the air bubbles out of the syringe.
6. Push the plunger up to the number (mL) on the syringe that matches the dose your doctor prescribed. The extra medicine will run out of the needle tip. Hold the syringe in one hand.
7. Pick up the exposed alcohol pad with the other hand. Use firm pressure to clean the skin on the injection site. Start at the center of the site and move outward in a circular motion. Allow the skin to dry before injecting.
8. Hold the syringe in the hand you will use to inject.
Medication Guide
81

Medication Guide
9. Use the other hand to pinch a fold of skin at the chosen site. Hold the syringe as you would a pen or pencil when you are ready to write. Insert the needle into the skin in one quick motion. Insert it at a straight up and down (90 degrees) or at a slight angle (45 degrees). (Figure 3) Do not place your thumb on the plunger yet.
10. After the needle is inserted, let go of the skin. Use your thumb (on dominant hand) to pull the plunger back slightly. If no blood appears, use your thumb to slowly push the plunger all the way down. Push it until all the medicine is injected. (Figure 4) If blood comes into the syringe, do not inject the medicine. This means that the needle has entered a blood vessel. Withdraw the syringe and discard it in the sharps container. Then begin again with a new prefilled syringe and choose and clean a new injection site.
11. When the syringe is empty, pull it straight out of the skin. Place a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site and press for several seconds.
12. Do not recap the needle.
13. Keep your hands behind the needle at all times. While holding the clear plastic finger grip of the syringe with one hand, grasp the needle guard with your free hand. Slide the needle guard over the needle until the needle is completely covered. You will hear the needle guard click into place. If you do not hear it click, the needle guard may not be completely in place. (Figure 5)
14. Place the syringe with the needle guard covering the needle into the sharps container.
Special Points
 Inject the medicine at the same time each day. If you miss a dose contact your doctor or nurse.
 Always wash your hands before you start the procedure.
 Work in a clean area. Do not use the bathroom as a work area.
 Do not allow anything to touch the needle. If anything touches it, you must use a
new prefilled syringe. A needle that is not sterile can cause an infection.
 Always check to see if you have the right amount of medicine in the syringe.
 Prefilled syringes should be used only once.
 Put the syringes in a suitable sharps container. It can be an empty plastic bleach or
detergent bottle with a cap or a coffee can with a tight lid.
 Label the container (e.g., Home Sharps). Keep all equipment and medicine out
of the reach of children and pets.
 When the container is 60 to 80% full, secure the lid or cap with strong tape. In New
York City, you can discard the container with household waste. For other counties,
call your Department of Health. You can also return it to your nurse at Memorial.
 Please call your doctor or nurse if you have any questions or concerns.

Advice from Other Parents
What to bring with you to the hospital
Dont bring everything all at once. The room (and everything in it) needs to be cleaned from time to time. It is better to bring in toys, clothes, etc, in stages rather than have to take everything out and clean it.
Make sure you have a lot of comfortable day clothes. Clothes need to be changed a lot due to sweating or fevers.
For babies and toddlers, BabyLegs are great. They are long leg warmers for the child to wear instead of full pants  much easier than regular pants so you dont have to take pants on and off all the time when changing diapers. (Babylegs.com)
An iTouch. We downloaded all of her favorite movies onto it and she watched them on the iTouch all the time.
Large storage bins to keep toys organized. Small toys are better to bring because they take up less space and are easier to manage.
Water toys for bath time and fragrance free bath soap. Their skin gets very sensitive.
Food
Bring small size snack food packages with you. Large packages of snack can go stale or collect germs. The 100 calories packs are great.
Dont expect your child too eat a lot all the time. Vomiting, nauseau, and diarrhea are normal.
Creating a Home Away from Home
Bring your childs familiar things from home. Bring pictures of family and friends to hang on the wall.
Create a designated play area on the floor to help keep the room organized.
Create a schedule for the day  it makes the day go quicker. Child life comes every day at the same time so that gives me a break. Then we have playtime, DVD time, then PT/OT, and dance.
  This section is a work in progress. Please share your tips with us so that we can include them for future families.
Send any ideas to ramirezk@mskcc.org or call 646-888-5676.

How to Perform Urine Collection for Creatinine Clearance
Creatinine is a substance that is present in your blood. It is normally removed by the kidneys. The purpose of a creatinine clearance test is to see how well your kidneys are working. The test measures the amount of creatinine present in your urine during a 24- hour period. It is important that you collect all your urine during this time period.
URINE COLLECTION
Start __________ Date End __________ Date
__________ Time __________ Time
How to Save your Urine for Collection
 Drink at least two quarts of fluid the day you collect the urine.
 You must start the urine collection with an empty bladder. Right before you start the
test, urinate and discard the urine. Write down the time. This is the beginning of the test, which will end 24 hours later.
 Each time you urinate during the 24-hour urine collection, save the urine in the container we will give you. The collection container must be refrigerated at all times. If you leave your home during the test, take the container with you.
Special Points
 Let the nurse know if you forget to save a urine during the collection period.
 You must also have blood drawn. This will be done when you bring your urine to the
hospital. The creatinine clearance cannot be done without the blood specimen.

Diet Changes From Treatment
Side effects from treatment may make it hard for you to eat. Some physical side effects include:
 Loss of appetite.
 Sore mouth.
 Changed sense of taste.  Nausea.
 Vomiting.
 Diarrhea.
 Constipation.
 Weight gain.
The emotional side of cancer treatment may also affect your eating habits. When people are upset, worried, or afraid, they may have eating problems. Losing your appetite and feeling sick can be normal when you are nervous or afraid. The treatment team can help you and your family plan the food to serve at home. Let them know if you notice a loss or gain in weight. Ask what has worked for other children. The good news is that even children who have trouble eating have days when eating is a pleasure. The following suggestions for parents and caregivers may help:
Serve appealing food.
 Build meals around favorite foods. Parents should not force favorite foods during nausea attacks. Forcing may cause a lasting dislike of the food.
 Try always to have high-calorie foods (for example, macaroni and cheese with real butter and cheese, or milkshakes made with ice cream). Add instant breakfast powders to all milk and milk products.
Adopt a casual attitude about mealtimes.
 Parents should let their child eat whenever he or she is hungry or offer food often during the day. Have high-calorie, high-protein snacks handy. Taking just a few bites of the right foods or sips of the right liquids every hour or so can help increase the intake of proteins and calories. Portions of a favorite dish can be frozen and served they are wanted.
 Oral medicines may affect appetite. Some are best given in the morning, some at midday, and some on a full stomach. Ask the doctor when and how medicines should be given. Tell the doctor if there is a change in appetite or if there are any other side effects.
 Try changing the time, place, and surroundings of meals. A picnic, even if it is in the house, can make mealtime more fun. Watching a favorite TV show or having a special friend over at meal or snack time also can help your child feel more like eating.
Food Guide
107

Create a pleasant setting.
 Make mealtimes calm and relaxed. Do not hurry meals.
 Praise good eating. Try using small rewards, such as a favorite dessert or a new toy,
to encourage good eating. Siblings should be considered when setting up a reward system. It is important that siblings are not left out, but be careful not to encourage healthy siblings to overeat.
 Avoid arguing, nagging, or punishing. Forcing a child to eat may make things worse.
If your child's eating becomes a serious problem, ask the doctor about medicines that can improve appetite. Sometimes children gain extra weight during treatment because of the buildup of excess water in the body. Do not put your child on a diet. Instead, call the doctor. If the weight gain is due to extra water, the doctor may recommend using less salt. Salt causes the body to hold onto water. The doctor may also order medicines called diuretics to get rid of the excess water.
Children who have cancer need diets high in calories and protein. High-calorie foods help prevent weight loss. Protein foods help the body stay strong and repair itself. To get your child to eat more protein and calories, try these tips:
 Offer liquids during the day, but not at mealtimes. Liquids are filling and take away an appetite for solid foods. Give your child a straw to make drinking easier.
 Some types of chemotherapy may change your child's sense of taste for a while. Well-seasoned foods, such as spaghetti, tacos, and pizza, may seem good at these times. Sometimes, adding extra salt or sugar, or using less, may make foods taste better.
 Avoid empty-calorie foods, such as soft drinks, chips, and candy. These can make your child's appetite worse without providing good nutrition. Milkshakes, yogurt, fruit, juices, or "instant breakfasts" provide extra calories and protein.

Foods that Contain Magnesium, Calcium, and/or Potassium
Magnesium
Magnesium is an essential mineral that:
 Helps keep the heart rhythm steady.
 Helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function.
 Is involved with other minerals to maintain strong bones and good health.
Your body regulates magnesium levels by shifting magnesium into and out of cells. Some chemotherapy drugs (e.g., cisplatin) may cause a loss of magnesium and potassium in the urine.
Eating a variety of whole grains, legumes, and dark green, leafy vegetables daily will help provide enough magnesium. The table below lists a variety of foods to show you the magnesium content of each.

Potassium is a mineral that helps keep blood pressure within normal range. It is also important for muscle contraction and for maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance in the body. The United States Department of Agriculture recommends that adults should have at least 4,700 mg of potassium each day. Even if your blood pressure is normal, foods that are rich in potassium should still be part of your diet. Add some of the potassium rich foods below to your daily diet:

 Calcium
Food Guide
Your body needs calcium in your diet everyday to keep bones and teeth strong and maintain healthy muscle and nerve function. When calcium in the diet is low, your body makes up for this by taking calcium from your bones.
The recommended daily calcium intake for children and adolescents varies by age:
06 months 712 months 13 years 48 years 918 years

Low Microbial Diet and Food Safety Guidelines
This diet is prescribed when you have had a recent bone marrow transplant or have a low neutrophil count. A neutrophil is a type of white blood cell. Your white blood cell count tells how well your body can fight off infections. This diet may reduce the risk of illness from foods containing microbes. Microbes include bacteria, viruses, yeast, or molds. When they get into foods, they can cause infections, especially in people who are ill.
What Makes Food Unsafe?
Bacteria can attach to foods and grow. You cannot always see, smell, or taste them.
Germs are more likely on:
 Milk and other dairy food items that are not refrigerated.
 Undercooked and raw eggs and foods that have raw eggs (e.g., cookie dough and
Caesar salad dressing).
 Undercooked or raw meat, poultry, and seafood.
 Certain fruits and vegetables (see fruit and vegetable listing on the Diet Guidelines).
 Unpasteurized or untreated juices (e.g., fresh-squeezed juices).
 Vegetable sprouts (e.g., raw alfalfa, soy bean, radish sprouts).
Buying Food that is Safe to Eat
 Do not buy canned foods if the can has dents or is swollen.
 Do not buy food in jars if the jar is cracked or the lid is not tightly closed.
 Check eggs by opening the carton to see if any are broken or cracked. Only buy
eggs that are refrigerated in the store.
 Separate ready-to-eat and raw foods. Put raw meat, poultry, seafood, and other
raw foods in plastic bags before they go into your cart.
 Pick up your milk and other cold foods at the end of your shopping. This lessens the
time they are not refrigerated.
 Check containers for the expiration date. Buy and use food before that date.
Personal Hygiene
Clean hands are essential. Wash your hands with soap and water:  Before preparing or eating food.
 After using the restroom.
 After cleaning up a child.
 After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.  After handling garbage.
 After treating a cut or wound.

Food Safety at Home
Storing Food Safely
 Store food immediately after shopping.
 Put eggs inside the refrigerator; do not store them in the door. The temperature
inside is more consistent than the door area.
Kitchen Cleanliness
A clean area for preparing and eating food is necessary to prevent the spread of germs.
Counter Tops
 Use paper towels or clean cloths instead of sponges to clean kitchen surfaces.
 Use an antibacterial cleansing spray to clean surfaces. Look for products that have
bleach or ammonia. Examples are Lysol Food Surface Sanitizer and Clorox Clean- Up Cleaner.
Cutting Boards and Equipment
 Use nonporous cutting boards such as plastic, marble, glass, or ceramic. Avoid wood or other porous surfaces.
 Wash cutting boards with hot soapy water before using them for the next food.
 As an extra precaution, wash your cutting boards with a kitchen sanitizer. Throw out
worn or hard-to-clean cutting boards.
 Use a produce brush to clean fruit and vegetables when appropriate.
Safe Food Handling
 Rinse fresh produce under running tap water. Rinse skins and rinds that are not eaten. Never use bleach or detergent to wash fresh fruits and vegetables.
 Rub firm-skinned fruits and vegetables under running warm tap water or scrub with a clean vegetable brush while rinsing with running tap water.
 Remove and throw away any damaged or bruised areas on produce.
 Cook all foods thoroughly.
 Separate raw meats from ready-to-eat food.
 Thaw foods:

 Cook to proper temperatures.
 Store at proper temperatures.
 Keep your refrigerator at 33-40o F.
 Keep your freezer at 0o F or below.
 Store leftovers in a shallow container. To cool them faster, put them in the freezer or
refrigerator as soon as you finish eating. Use them within 2 days to prevent spoilage.
 Reheat leftovers to 165oF.
 Use a food thermometer to test the temperatures of cooked and reheated foods.
 Do not eat hamburgers and other meat products if the meat looks undercooked.
 Cook until the meat is grey and the juices run clear.

Information for Transplant Donors
Chemotherapy and radiation destroy patients stem cells. The bone marrow or stem cells that you donate will be given to the patient. The donated cells or marrow will grow, mature, and replace the patients destroyed cells.
Blood and bone marrow donation is a voluntary process. You agree to allow doctors to draw blood stem cells from your blood or bone marrow for transplantation.
Blood and bone marrow donation provides blood stem cells for transplantation. In the past, all donors had to undergo surgery to draw bone marrow containing blood stem cells from the hipbones.
Today, however, it's more common to collect blood stem cells directly from the blood. This is called peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donation.
Bone Marrow Harvesting
Physicians harvest bone marrow from the pelvic bones or hip in an operating room while the donor is under general anesthesia. The physician inserts a hollow needle into the rear and sometimes the front hipbone, both of which contain a large quantity of bone marrow. The breastbone is another accessible site that is rich in marrow, but this is very rarely used for harvest. The physician often must pierce the bone in several spots to obtain enough marrow for a transplant. The donor will not need stitches but will have some pain and tenderness at the site of the harvest for about a week.
Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Harvesting
Until the past few years, physicians harvested stem cells only from the bone marrow. Using a newer procedure, physicians may collect stem cells from the circulating blood. This procedure, unlike a bone marrow harvest, does not have to be done in an operating room, and the donor does not have to be under general anesthesia.
Stem cells are blood cells that have not matured. When stem cells mature, they become a specific kind of blood cell, such as a red blood cell or a platelet. Peripheral blood is blood that is found in blood vessels. It has every kind of blood cell. Peripheral stem cell harvesting is the procedure used to collect some of the stem cells in your blood.
Preparation
Before the harvesting is done, you will receive a medicine called G-CSF. It helps move the stem cells from the bone marrow where they are made, into the circulating blood. When stem cells are in the circulating blood they can be collected. You will get this medicine by injection under the skin twice a day for about five to six days. You will either be taught to do the injections yourself, or you can discuss other arrangement for these injections with your nurse.
Common side effects of G-CSF include bone pain in the arms, legs, and lower back. It can also cause headaches and flu-like symptoms. Either regular or extra strength Tylenol may relieve these side effects. If Tylenol does not help, the doctor will prescribe something stronger. At the end of this booklet is a chart listing the dates for getting the G-
125

Information for Transplant Donors
CSF and having your stem cells harvested. If you will be giving yourself the G-CSF, you must store it in the refrigerator.
Harvesting
The harvesting procedure takes place in the Donor Room. It is located at 1250 First Avenue (between 67th and 68th Streets). You will have two appointments on consecutive days. On these days, you will get the dose of G-CSF at least one hour before your appointment. The harvesting is done while you are on a bed or in a recliner chair. It usually takes 3-4 hours. A needle will be inserted into a vein in each arm. A machine that separates the stem cells from your blood will be connected to the needle in one arm. The blood goes through the machine to collect the stem cells. The rest of the blood returns to you through the needle in your other arm.
As the stem cells are collected some donors have:
 Muscle cramps.
 Twitching.
 A tingling sensation around their lips and on their fingertips.
These are signs of a low calcium level in the blood. To help reduce these effects, on the night before and the morning of your stem cell harvest dates you should:
 Drink milk.
 Eat cottage cheese and other dairy foods.
The Donor Room staff can also give you Tums tablets. These are a quick and easy source of calcium.
After the Procedure:
 Dressings will be applied where the needles were inserted into your arms.
 Keep the dressings in place for three hours.
 If there is bleeding when you remove the dressings, apply gentle but firm pressure to
the sites. Do this for three to five minutes. Call your doctor if the bleeding does not
stop.
 Most donors can go back to their regular activities the day of or the day after the
donation.
Call your doctor if you:
 Develop a fever of 100.4  F (38  C) or higher.
 Have any redness, bleeding, pain, or swelling where the needles were inserted.
 Have any questions or concerns.

Pediatric Survivorship Programs
Long-Term Follow-Up Program
Survivorship
 Over the past several decades, dramatic strides have been made in the battle against childhood cancers. Today, about one in every 500 young adults in the United States has survived a childhood malignancy. Initial studies done at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and at other centers around the country show a majority of childhood cancer survivors living full, healthy lives.
To meet the health care needs of childhood cancer survivors, Memorial Sloan-Kettering developed a unique Long-Term Follow-Up Program. Charles A. Sklar is the director of the program. Dr. Sklar is a pediatrician that specializes in endocrinology and the care of childhood cancer survivors. Memorial Sloan-Kettering's Long-Term Follow-Up Program is available to children, adolescents, and adults who have been off treatment for about two years. The program offers the following services:
Initial Consultation & Treatment Summary
Prior to an initial long-term follow-up consultation, a patient's past cancer treatment record is reviewed and summarized. A team -- which includes a radiation oncologist, neuropsychologist, cardiologist, and primary medical oncologist -- meets to discuss the patient's past treatment and develop a plan for future health care management and screening. This summary is given to the patient and reviewed at the first visit. "We talk with the patient and family about all the potential late complications and the likelihood that they will or will not have these problems," says Dr. Sklar. In this way, an individualized screening and counseling program is created for each patient.
Screening & Treatment for Late Effects
A major focus of the program is early detection and treatment of existing or potential problems. While we expect that most survivors will have healthy, productive lives, some develop problems as a result of treatment. These delayed or late effects occur in some but not all people. They may be mild, moderate, or severe. Some late effects may not occur until years after treatment.
Whether or not late effects occur, depend on several factors, including:
 The type of cancer.
 Type of treatment received.
 A patient's age during treatment.
Some late effects may include hormone disturbances that may affect growth, puberty, and thyroid or fertility disorders. Often, these conditions are treated by the Long-Term Follow-Up Program. Other problems, such as heart and learning difficulties, are closely watched by the team. Patients are referred to clinical specialists when necessary.
128

Referrals & Coordination of Health Care
The Long-Term Follow-Up Program works with patients' oncologists and other healthcare providers to ensure well-coordinated care. The program is not intended to replace the primary care provider or pediatric oncologist. Once off treatment, it is recommended that patients establish a relationship with a regular, local healthcare provider. This person will be available for sick visits as well as routine, yearly physical examinations. In addition to making referrals to specialists, we also make referrals to available community resources for childhood cancer survivors.
Transitioning to the Adult Survivor Program
The Adult Survivor Program was developed in 2005 to serve the needs of patients entering their adult years. The program is directed by Kevin Oeffinger, MD. He is a family physician who has served the healthcare needs of adult survivors of pediatric cancer for over twelve years. He is assisted by Beth Whittam, CFNP, RN, and Roseann Tucci, CANP, RN. They are both nurse practitioners with many years of experience working with pediatric cancer survivors. Lastly, Page Tolbert, CSW, is a social worker for the program and directs the efforts targeted for young adults.
Patients are transitioned to the Adult Survivor Program around the age of 25 years. The patients are seen in the same clinic area, just by another healthcare team that specializes in delivering care for adult survivors of pediatric cancer.
Health Education
One of the program's goals is to provide information to patients about staying healthy. It is important for patients and families to be educated about the effects of past cancer treatments. We also focus on how to prevent future health problems and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
Learning to Prevent Problems
Dr. Sklar and Dr. Oeffinger participate in a large national study of cancer survivors. "We contacted 14,000 survivors of cancer throughout the United States and had them complete a detailed questionnaire," Dr. Sklar reports. "Right now, we're analyzing the data and learning for the first time how people are doing in their late 20s, 30s, and 40s. Through this and other research that we do here at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, we're trying understand and prevent problems in the future."
