A PET scan is an imaging procedure. It is used to detect and diagnose many disorders or to plan your radiation therapy. This card describes the PET scan, how to get ready for it, and what you must do after the scan.

### Uses of PET
PET shows how tissues and organs in the body work.  Abnormal or diseased tissue often works differently than normal tissue. Your doctor can make important observations if there are changes in function. A PET scan may be used to:

* Check for disease. 
* Learn more about how a tumor functions. 
* Assess if therapy works. 
* Tell active tumor apart from scar tissue. 

### The Tracer
A PET scan requires an injection of a radioactive drug called a tracer. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is most often used. FDG and most other tracers for PET scans do not stay in the body long. Most PET scans are done to study the bodys use of glucose (a type of sugar) because cancerous tumors take in glucose faster than normal tissue. 

Having a PET scan is like other nuclear medicine and radiology tests such as a CT scan. The radiation from the tracer is different from X rays. It is about half of the dose you get from a CT scan. 

### Before Your PET Scan
* Some patients feel nervous or anxious in an enclosed area such as the inside of the scanning ring. Speak with your doctor ahead of time about medicine to relax. 
* Tell your doctor or the doctor or nurse in Nuclear Medicine or Radiation Oncology if you:
- Are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. 
- Are breast feeding. 
- Have diabetes. We will work with you and your doctor to determine the safest way for you to prepare for your scan. 
* A staff member will call you the day before your PET scan to: 
- Confirm what day and time to arrive. 
- Give you an estimate of how long the procedure will take. This estimate may need to be adjusted the day of your scan, depending on the type of PET scan you are having. 
- Review the steps below.  

### The Day of Your PET Scan
* If you have diabetes, you may not be able to follow the guidelines below. Talk to your doctor about how to prepare for the test. 
* For six hours before your arrival time:
- Do not eat anything.
- You may drink only water or coffee or tea without milk, cream or sugar. 
- Do not chew gum or suck hard candy, cough drops, or mints. 
Your scan may be rescheduled if you eat anything or drink something other than water, plain coffee or tea. 
* If you take medicines, take them with water only. 
* If you have a fever or chills, please tell us. Any shaking or movement during the scan will reduce the quality of the image. 
* Avoid strenuous activity such as running, jogging, or cycling for 24 hours before your PET scan. This can lead to a poor quality scan. 
* Bring your latest CT and MRI scans if they were not done here or you have not submitted them to be put in our system. 

### When You Arrive For Your Pet Scan
The time for the cells to absorb the tracer and for scanning are adjusted based on the area being scanned. These are some of the general steps: 

* At the main hospital, register in Nuclear Medicine or the Department of Radiation Oncology. At the regional network sites, register in the Radiology department. Fill out a brief questionnaire. 
* A fingerstick will be done or blood will be drawn to measure your sugar level. A doctor or nurse will inject the tracer into a vein. 
* You will wait 45 to 60 minutes for the cells in your body to absorb the tracer. Relax and limit your movement during this time. Read, listen to music, or watch videos in an area provided for you. 
* You will urinate just before the scan. 
* When we are ready to do your scan, the technologist will position you on the scanning table. It may feel cool in the room but blankets are available to keep you warm. 
* The table will move slowly through the scanning ring. It is similar to the large donut-shape scanner used for CT scans. 
* You must lie very still in the scanning ring until the procedure is done. This can take 30 to 45 minutes, depending on the type of PET scan. 

### After Your PET Scan
* You may leave as soon as your PET scan is done unless other tests or procedures are scheduled.
* You will get a card from MSKCC stating that you had a test done with the aid of a radiotracer. 
* Drink a lot of water or other liquids to remove the tracer from your body. 
* Go back to your usual diet right away, unless you are given other instructions. 
* Do not have prolonged close contact with infants or pregnant women for 24 hours after your scan. 
* If you are breast feeding, stop for 24 hours. You can manage your lactation schedule with a breast pump during the 24-hour period but discard the milk pumped during this time. 
* A doctor will read the scan. The results are usually ready for your doctor in two work days. If you have questions or concerns, please speak with your doctor.
