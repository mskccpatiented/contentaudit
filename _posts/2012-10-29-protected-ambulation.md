### What Is Protected Walking?
Protected walking is a kind of careful, limited walking. Your doctor may prescribe protected walking for different reasons, including a fracture (broken bone) or possible fracture of your hip, leg, or foot. It can also be prescribed for thigh or leg surgery. A brace, cast, or splint may be used along with a walking aid, such as crutches, a cane, or a walker.
  
It is important to follow your doctors instructions to protect your leg or hip. A physical therapist will teach you how to walk correctly. He/she will also adjust your cane, walker, or crutches to the height that works best for you or will teach you how to make these adjustments.

### Types of Protected Walking

#### Non-weight-bearing

* None of your body weight may be put on the affected leg.
* Your foot must not touch the floor. 
* Crutches or a walker are used to help you walk. 
Flat foot touch-down weight-bearing
* No more than 10 pounds may be put on the affected leg. 
* Your foot can touch the floor to keep you balanced, but do not put any other weight on the affected leg. 
* Crutches or a walker are used to help you walk.
Partial weight-bearing
* 10% to 50% of your body weight may be put on the affected leg. Your physician will tell you how much body weight you can put on the affected leg.
* Crutches or a walker are used to help you walk. 
Weight-bearing as tolerated
* 50% to 100% of your body weight may be put on the affected leg, depending on how comfortable you feel. The amount that you can tolerate may be different from time to time. 
* Crutches (1 or 2) or a cane are used to help you walk. 

#### Full weight-bearing 

* Your entire body weight may be put on the affected leg. 
* Your doctor may also recommend a walking aid, such as a crutch or cane. 

### Important Notes
* Avoid twisting motions on the affected leg - this will lessen the chance of further injury.
