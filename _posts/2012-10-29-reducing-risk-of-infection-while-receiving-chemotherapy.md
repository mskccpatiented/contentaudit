This information will help you avoid infection while being treated with chemotherapy.
Some types of chemotherapy may lower the number of white blood cells in your body. White blood cells are also called neutrophils. Having fewer neutrophils can increase your risk of infection. 
The most important way to prevent infection is to wash your hands thoroughly. Do this by scrubbing your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use a waterless alcohol hand sanitizer (such as Purell¨) if soap and water are not available. Wash often, especially in the following situations: 
* Before and after preparing meals, and especially after handling raw meat or seafood
* After using the bathroom
* After changing diapers
* After handling animals
* After cleaning litter boxes, fish tanks, or pet cages 
* Whenever your hands look dirty

You should also do the following to prevent infection:
* Ask members of your healthcare team if they washed their hands before seeing you. 
* Avoid getting cuts or scrapes on your skin. Clean them right away with warm water and soap. Then, cover the area with a clean bandage.
* Avoid sharing personal items, such as toothbrushes and eating and drinking utensils.
* Wash raw fruits and vegetables before eating.
* Perform regular body and dental hygiene. Check with your doctor before having dental work.
* Check with your doctor before having any surgeries or procedures.
* Check with your doctor before getting any vaccinations.
* When possible, avoid anyone with symptoms of a cold (i.e., sneezing, coughing, and sore throat), a rash, or a recent vaccination. If you have any questions, speak with your doctor or nurse.
Your doctor and nurse will give you more instructions if your neutrophil count gets too low.

Call Your Doctor or Nurse if You Have
* A temperature of 100.4¡ F (38¡ C) or higher
* Shaking chills or sweats
* A rash 
* Any unexpected or unexplained problems
* Any questions or concerns
