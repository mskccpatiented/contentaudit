Reproductive endocrinologists are doctors with special training in fertility and reproductive health. They can:

* Evaluate your fertility
* Offer options to preserve your fertility before treatment
* Offer options to build a family after cancer treatment

### Other Locations
If you want to find a reproductive endocrinologist/fertility in another region of the country:

* Ask your local gynecologist or oncologist for a suggestion.
* Search the Fertility Resource Guide in the Fertile Hope internet site at www.fertilehope.org.
* Search the Find a Clinic under IVF Success Rate Reports in the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (SART) internet site at www.sart.org.

Click each center listed to learn more. The ART Data Report has information about the centers success rates. Key things to look for are:
- Total Cycles: This reports how many patients the center treated in the selected year.
- Thawed Embryos from Non-Donor Oocytes: The percentage of transfers resulting in live births gives you some idea of success rates in patients with infertility using frozen embryos.

In deciding where to go, you may want to ask the following questions:

* How many cancer patients do they treat each year?
* Can they offer you the specific treatment(s) you are considering? Examples are embryo freezing, egg freezing, ovarian tissue freezing, donor eggs, donor embryos, donor sperm, or gestational carrier.
* Can they see you within a few days if you will be starting cancer treatment?
* Is the location feasible for you? You may have to go every day for 10-14 days.
Do they work with LIVESTRONGs Sharing Hope program? This program offers discounted rates for eligible patients* . To find out if you are eligible and what is covered, select Financial Assistance in the internet site at www.fertilehope.org or call (866) 965-7205.
