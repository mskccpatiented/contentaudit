It is common for people to feel changes in their body during and after cancer treatment. There may be things you can see right away, like surgical scars, drainage tubes, and venous catheters. You may experience a loss of hair, a change in your weight, pain, or fatigue. These physical changes may affect how you feel about yourself or how you relate to your partner. They can affect your interest in sexual activity. They may also lessen your enjoyment and pleasure. During this time, there are things you can do to help you adjust and cope. Some suggestions, services, and resources are listed below.

Suggestions for how to feel better about yourself:

* Recognize the things that you enjoy about yourself or make you feel special. These may be related to your family, friends, personal interests, or work life.
* Spend time doing activities and being with people that you enjoy.
* If your faith is important, maintain your spiritual or religious practices.
* Choose clothes that make you feel good.
* Have favorite clothes altered to fit better.
* Wear scarves, attractive caps or a favorite hat.
* Take part in the Look Good, Feel Better program (see information below).

Suggestions for how to maintain physical intimacy with your partner:
 
* Talk with your partner about your physical relationship. Talk about what you think would help you feel close and give you both pleasure. Share your concerns so that you can find solutions together.
* Increase intimate and sensual touching. Hug, caress, cuddle, touch, and hold hands to feel closer to each other.
 
If intercourse is difficult or uncomfortable:
 
* Consider different sexual positions. Some may be less tiring or more comfortable. Vaginal moisturizers or lubricants can be helpful for women. 
* Medications to assist with erections may be helpful for men.
Special points related to sexual activity:
* Consider a time for relations when you have more energy.
* Being relaxed can help improve sexual enjoyment. Select a time and place when you can relax and have privacy.
* If pregnancy is possible, use birth control during your cancer treatment. Ask your doctor how long you should use birth control after your treatment is over.

Ask your doctor or nurse if your blood counts are high enough for you to have safe sex. The white blood cell count should be high enough to prevent infection. The platelet count should be high enough to prevent bleed- ing. Ask if there are any safety measures you should use for different types of sexual activity (oral, anal, vaginal).

Speak with your doctor or nurse if:
 
* You have vaginal dryness or tightness that makes sexual activity painful. Simple solutions are available to help. You may also be referred to our Female Sexual Health Program.
* You have difficulty getting or maintaining an erection. He or she can recommend medicine that may help. You may also be referred to our Male Sexual and Reproductive Medicine Program.
* You have difficulty with incontinence. He or she can give you a referral to our Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Center.
