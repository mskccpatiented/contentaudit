### Skin and Hair Reactions from Radiation Therapy 

#### Skin 
Changes in the skin and hair are common and expected during radiation therapy. Each person reacts in a different way. The likelihood and severity of a skin reaction depends on: 

* The area being treated 
* The type and dose of radiation given 
* Whether or not you are also getting chemotherapy 

Usually 2 or 3 weeks into your radiation treatment, your skin may become pink or tanned. As treatment continues, your skin may become bright red or very dark. Your skin may also feel dry and itchy, and it may look flaky. Some people develop a rash or even blisters in the treatment area. These blisters may open and peel. If you develop a skin reaction, it will most likely get better 3 to 4 weeks after your treatment is finished. 

#### Hair 
You may also lose some or all of your hair in the treatment area. The hair will usually grow back 2 to 4 months after your treatment is completed. 

### How to Care for Your Skin During Radiation 

#### Keep Your Skin Clean 

* Bathe or shower daily using warm water and a mild unscented soap. Examples of soaps you may use include Neutrogena, Dove, baby soap, Basis, and Cetaphil. Rinse the skin well, and pat dry with a soft towel. 
* When washing, be gentle with your skin in the area being treated. Do not use a washcloth or a scrubbing cloth or brush. 
* The tattoo marks are permanent and will not wash off. 
* You may get other markings during treatment, for example, a purple felt-tipped marker outline of your treatment area. You can use mineral oil to remove these lines once the treatment is completed. 
* Do not use alcohol or alcohol pads on the skin in the area being treated.

#### Moisturize Your Skin 

* If you are likely to get a skin reaction, your nurse will recommend that you start using a moisturizer. You should start using it the first day of treatment to minimize the reaction. If you are not likely to develop a skin reaction, you will not need a moisturizer unless your skin becomes dry or itchy. Your nurse will instruct you. If you are not certain whether you should use a moisturizer, please ask your nurse.
* There are many moisturizers you may use. Some can be purchased over the counter and some require a prescription. There is no evidence that any one moisturizer is best. Over-the-counter moisturizers you may use are Aquaphor or Eucerin or Calendula. We do not recommend using aloe vera directly from the plant as it is more likely to cause an allergic reaction. 
* If you do not like the feel of the moisturizer the doctor or nurse recommends, let them know. He or she can select another product for you to try. 

* Apply the moisturizer at least 2 times a day. 
o If you are treated in the morning, apply it: 
* After your treatment. 
* Before you go to bed. 
o If you are treated in the afternoon, apply it: 
* In the morning before your treatment. 
* Before you go to bed. 
o If you are not being treated that day, apply it: 
* In the morning. 
* Before you go to bed. 
* Do not wash off the moisturizer before your treatment. This is to avoid irritating your skin. 

Avoid Irritating the Skin in the Treatment Area 

* Wear loose-fitting cotton clothing over the treated area. 
Do not use any other moisturizers, creams, or lotions in the area being treated unless recommended by your doctor or nurse. 
* Do not use any of the following in the area being treated: 
o Make-up 
o Perfumes 
o Powders 
o Aftershave 
* Use non-aluminum based deodorant on intact skin, in the area being treated. Discontinue these if the skin becomes irritated. Examples are: 
o Toms of Maine 
o Crystal deodorants 
* Do not shave the treated skin. If you must shave, use only an electric razor. 
* Do not use any tape on the treated skin. 
* Do not apply extreme heat or cold to the treated skin. This includes hot tubs, water bottles, heating pads, and ice packs. 
* If you need to apply pain patch, do not apply it on the treated area. 
* If your skin is itchy, do not scratch it. Ask your nurse for recommendation on how to relieve the itching. 
* If you have no skin reaction, you may swim in a chlorinated pool. However, be sure to rinse off the chlorine right after leaving the pool. 
* Avoid tanning or burning your skin during treatment and for the rest of your life. If you are going to be in the sun, use a PABA-free sunblock with an SPF of 15 or higher. Also, wear clothing that covers you as much as possible. 

### When to Call for Help 
Remember that changes in the skin and hair are expected. Each person reacts differently. If you have any questions about how to care for your skin, please speak with your nurse or doctor. 

Also, contact your nurse or doctor if you develop any of the following: 

* Fever of 101 F (38.3 C) or higher
