This information will answer some frequently asked questions about sperm banking.

Many cancer treatments can damage the cells needed to make sperm. This means you may become infertile (unable to conceive a child). Sometimes the body can recover from this damage, but sometimes it cannot. We have no way of knowing for sure if you will be fertile after your treatment.

### What is sperm banking?
Sperm banking is the collection and freezing of sperm before you begin cancer treatment. Your sperm are stored in case you need them in the future to become a father. Sperm can be stored for as long as you want, even for many years.

### Why should I do this?
We know that right now you may not be thinking about being a father. However, in the future this may be very important to you. Sperm banking will increase your chance of being able to father a child using your own sperm.

Many young men who did not bank their sperm before treatment regret this decision. Later in life when they wanted to have children, they found out they were infertile. Many say they wish they had been pushed more by their families and doctors to do this. Because of this, we encourage all teens and young men to bank their sperm before treatment that may affect fertility.

### Where do I do this?
You will make an appointment at a sperm bank to collect sperm. At the end of this card there is information to help you find a sperm bank. Think about who you will feel most comfortable being with you when you go. This may be your parents, your friend, your spouse, or anyone else you feel comfortable with. You may also go alone.

### How do I do this?
At the sperm bank you will first complete some paperwork. Then you will be brought to a private room. The staff at the sperm bank will explain how to do the collection.

Before collecting, wash and dry your hands. You will need to excite yourself by masturbating. Do not use saliva, spit, or lubricants. These will destroy the sperm. The fluid (ejaculate) that comes out of the tip of your penis contains the sperm. You will collect all the fluid in a sterile cup. If you feel you cannot collect sperm this way, please tell your doctor or nurse. There may be others ways to collect.

We suggest you make 3 collections if possible. For the first collection, it is best if you donâ€™t have sex for 3 to 4 days before. This includes intercourse and masturbation. Then skip 1 or 2 days between the other collections. This will help you collect the highest possible number of sperm.

If you have to start treatment before you can do 3 collections that is okay. There are new techniques that allow fertilization of eggs even with very few sperm.

### How much will this cost?
The cost varies from one sperm bank to another. There are separate fees for analyzing, processing, freezing, and storing the sperm. The sperm bank may also need blood tests for certain infectious diseases. The cost in the New York area is generally about $1,000 for 3 collections.

Most insurance plans do not cover sperm banking. Call your insurance company to find out if you have coverage. Explain that you will be starting treatment for cancer. Your doctor has explained that treatment may cause you to become infertile and has recommended that you bank your sperm. Ask if it would help if they had a letter explaining this from your doctor.

You may be able to get financial assistance for fertility preservation before treatment from the Fertile Hope/LIVESTRONG program Sharing Hope. To find out if you are eligible and to see what is covered, look on their website, http://www.fertilehope.org/financial-assistance/

### Where can I learn more?
Please ask your nurse for the booklet Fertility and Cancer Treatment: Information for Men. For additional information and links to other resources, go to the MSKCC internet site at http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/92039.cfm or speak with your doctor.
