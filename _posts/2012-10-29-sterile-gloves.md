### Simple Captions
1. Open the package with the sterile gloves. Pull the edges of the package down to keep them flat.
2. Pick up one glove by the folded cuff. 
3. Still holding just the cuff, slide your other hand into the glove, making sure the outside of the glove does not touch anything. 
4. Slip the fingers on the gloved hand under the cuff of the other glove and hold it up and away from anything else. 
5. Keep the thumb on your gloved hand pointing up so it is out of the way. Slide your other hand into the glove. 
6. Pull the glove all the way up. Be careful not to anything, including your wrist.
