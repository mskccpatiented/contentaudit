At MSKCC we have a plan of care for our patients who have completed treatment for lymphoma. This plan is based on your individual needs. You have passed the time when most problems from lymphoma occur. As a result, you no longer need the care of lymphoma specialists. You are ready to transition your care to your local primary care doctor. As scary as this may seem, this is good news! 

Since you completed treatment for lymphoma, you have been receiving follow-up care from your lymphoma doctor. You may have had visits with more than one doctor depending on the treatments you received. Your lymphoma doctor focused on your long-term physical and emotional needs, such as taking care of any effects from your treatment.  After each of these visits, your lymphoma doctor sent information to your local primary care doctor. This was done to keep your local doctor informed so that at some time all your care could be transferred there. 

### Frequently Asked Questions (Redundant)
### How will my primary care doctor know about my lymphoma treatment?
Your lymphoma doctor will send your local primary care doctor a detailed summary of your care at MSKCC. This report will include information about the treatment you received, your most recent test results, and recommendations for follow-up based your treatment. 

What other care will I need?

### Treatment Related Screening
Sometimes after treatment people develop other health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, thyroid disease, or cancer. Your lymphoma doctor will review specific recommendations for your follow up with you. We will also send this information to your local primary care physician. For information about cancer screening, refer to the booklet MSKCC Guidelines for Cancer Screening.

### General Recommendations

* Get the flu vaccine every year.  
* Get the pneumonia vaccine every 5 years.  
* Have your cholesterol checked every year. 
* Continue to follow your doctors recommendations for diet and exercise and take medications as prescribed. 
I see doctors at MSKCC for reasons not related to cancer. Can I continue? 

If you see physicians at MSKCC for diseases other than cancer, you may transfer that care to your primary care doctor or to a specialist in your community. You should talk to your MSKCC doctors and your primary care doctor about transferring your care.

### What if I have another lymphoma problem and need to come back? 
If you have any problems related to lymphoma or your lymphoma treatment, we want you to come to MSKCC. We will provide you and your primary care doctor with a phone number to call for an appointment.
