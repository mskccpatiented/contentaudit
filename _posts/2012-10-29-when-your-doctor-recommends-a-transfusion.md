Your doctor has recommended a blood transfusion. Many people have questions about why they need a blood transfusion. Some worry about the risk of AIDS or other viruses. The answers to some of the most commonly asked questions are included in this booklet. If you have additional questions, please ask your doctor.

### Why is a transfusion necessary?
Blood transfusions are given to replace blood that has been lost through disease, surgery, or other treatment. Sometimes surgery results in the loss of a large amount of blood. Some diseases and some treatments can lower the number of certain cells in the blood. 

The cells in the blood do many things.  Red cells carry oxygen to the tissues, platelets help form clots to prevent bleeding, and white cells help fight infections. Blood transfusions may be necessary to replace the amount of blood, the cells, or both.

### Does it hurt?
The only pain involved is when the needle is inserted in the vein. The pain is brief. If you have an indwelling catheter, the blood may be given through it. This does not hurt at all. If you have a Mediport, it will be the same needle stick that you have for chemotherapy.

### How long does it take?
A transfusion of red blood cells usually takes two to four hours. Transfusions of other blood components, like platelets, takes only 15-30 minutes. 

It takes about four hours for the blood to be released to the unit so the patient can get it. If it is needed urgently, it can be done in two hours.

### Are there risks associated with blood transfusions?
Yes, blood transfusions have some risks. These risks include the very slight chance of having an allergic reaction or acquiring an infection through tainted blood.

### How can I be sure the blood is safe?
After it is donated, the blood is tested for:
 
* Syphilis
* Hepatitis B and C
* Exposure to the AIDS virus
* The presence of a virus associated with a very rare form of leukemia. 
* West Nile virus
* Trypanosoma Cruzi

The chance of getting any of these from donated blood is very small.

### Can a friend or relative donate specifically to me? 
Yes, friends and relatives can donate both red blood cells and platelets. These are called directed donations. They are tested in the same way as other donations.  If any of the blood tests are positive, the donor is notified privately. The person to whom the blood is directed is told only that the blood is not available. If the blood type is not compatible with the patients, the red blood cells are released into the Blood Banks general inventory.

Directed donations will be held for a patient for 30 days. After that, the blood goes into the general inventory. It can then be given to any patient. 

### Can anything bad happen during or after the transfusion?
Transfusions sometimes cause reactions. The most common symptoms are fever, chills, and hives. These can be treated with a variety of medicines. Transfusion reactions are rarely life threatening. Nursing staff constantly check all patients while a blood transfusion is taking place.

### How can I be sure the blood I receive is the same type as mine?
Your blood is one of the following blood types: A, B, AB, or O and it is either Rh positive or Rh negative. Your blood type is checked with a test called a type and crossmatch. The results of the test are used to match your blood type with the blood in our Blood Bank.

### Can I give blood for myself? 
Under  certain circumstances the Hospital encourages patients scheduled for surgery to donate their own blood. It is stored and given back if and when you need it. This is called an autologous donation. Ask your doctor if you can donate your own blood. If this is possible, arrangements will be made with the Blood Bank for you to begin banking your blood. Autologous blood donations may be given several times during the month before surgery.

### What if I don't want a blood transfusion?
It is always your right as a patient to refuse a treatment your doctor thinks is best. Doctors recommend a transfusion only when they think it is necessary. A large amount of blood is commonly lost during some types of surgery. If this blood is not replaced, the patient can die.  Some diseases and treatments lower the number of red cells, so the patient does not have enough oxygen carrying cells. Some lower the number of platelets, which puts the patient at high risk of bleeding. Any of these complications can be life-threatening. A blood transfusion can be life-saving.

### Are there any substitutes for blood if I need a transfusion?
There are no substitutes for blood. This is why we are so grateful to the many family members and friends who donate blood for the benefit of our patients.

### Is there anything to worry about after a transfusion?
Allergic reactions can sometimes occur. Symptoms are listed below. They can occur up to 48 hours after the transfusion. Call your doctor immediately if you have:

* Fever (100.4 F or 38 C or higher) or chills.
* Flushing of the face. 
* Hives, rash, or itching.
* Trouble breathing or shortness of breath.
* Low back pain.
* Nausea or vomiting.
* Weakness or fainting.
* Blood in the urine.
* Chest pain (If you have chest pain, call your local emergency number immediately.).

### Reference Section:

#### Facts About Blood
Blood is made up of plasma, which is 92 percent water, and three types of blood cells:

* Red blood cells carry oxygen to the tissues.
* Platelets help form clots and stop bleeding.
* White blood cells fight infection.
The number of each type of blood cell per volume of blood is calculated with a test called a complete blood count (CBC).

#### Red Blood Cells
Red blood cells carry oxygen to the tissues. We breathe in oxygen from the air and breathe out carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin in red blood cells carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues in all parts of the body.  It then carries carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. A decrease in the number of red blood cells causes anemia. Anemia is diagnosed when the hemoglobin level is low. Signs and symptoms of anemia are:

* Increased tiredness
* Generalized weakness
* Rapid heartbeat
* Shortness of breath
* Headache
* Pale skin

If you have anemia, your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following:

* A transfusion
* Adequate rest
* A diet high in iron (e.g., green leafy vegetables, liver, chicken)
* Iron supplements 

#### Platelets
Platelets help blood form clots and prevent bleeding. A low platelet count is called thrombocytopenia. The signs and symptoms are:

* Nosebleeds
* Bleeding gums
* Bruising
* Small red spots on the skin
* Blood in the urine or stool
* Bleeding that wont stop

If you have thrombocytopenia, your doctor may suggest one or more of the following:

* Brush your teeth with a soft toothbrush and floss your gums very gently or do not floss at all.
* Use an electric razor when shaving.
* Do not play contact sports or engage in rough play.
* Do not take aspirin, products containing aspirin, or other pain relievers such as ibuprofen.
* Do not use rectal suppositories, vaginal tampons, or take enemas.
* Be very careful when using sharp instruments.
* Wear gloves when gardening or cleaning.

Some thrombocytopenias are treated with a platelet transfusion; some require medication.

#### White Blood Cells
White blood cells fight infection. A low white blood cell count is called leukopenia. If you have a low white blood cell count, you should take precautions to prevent infections from developing in your mouth, lungs, skin, or urinary tract. Your doctor or nurse will provide you with specific guidelines. Try also to avoid people with colds or other infections. The signs and symptoms of infection are

* Fever (100.4 F or 38 C or higher).
* Shaking or chills.
* Cough.
* Sore throat.
* Generalized achiness.
* Burning sensation during urination.

If you have leukopenia, your doctor may suggest one or more of the following:

* Avoid crowds.
* Avoid known sources of infection.
* Monitor your temperature and report fever of 100? F (37.8 C) more.
* Get adequate rest.
* Use good hygiene.

If you have any questions, please ask your doctor or nurse.
