## Welcome &amp; Overview
Welcome to the Outpatient Autologous Stem Cell Transplant program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). 

### What's in This Guide
This guide will help you learn about autologous stem cell transplantation: what it is, why it's been recommended for you, and what happens in each phase of the transplant. The information in this guide will compliment the information your healthcare team will tell you.

### How to Use This Guide
You should read this entire guide at least once, including any additional materials included at the back of the guide. Refer to the guide as your treatment progresses.

As you read through this guide, make a note of any questions that come to mind. A member of your healthcare team will answer your questions the next time you seen them.

### We Need Your Help
We are always improving the information we provide to patients and their families/friends. If you get to the end of this guide and can think of ways it could be improved (maybe there's something that was missing, or wasn't completely clear), please email us at patiented@mskcc.org and we'll incorporate your feedback into the next version.

### Glossary
We've done our best to limit the number of medical terms in this guide, however there are some words that we need you to understand. With this in mind, we've prepared a glossary of useful terms and included it at the back of this guide.

<div class="phasedivider invisible">End of Glossary</div>

## Bone Marrow Basics

### What Is Bone Marrow? What Are Stem Cells?
<figure>

</figure>

Bone marrow is a substance found in the spaces in the center of the larger bones in your body: your hip, breastbone, and pelvis.

Your bone marrow contains a large number of stem cells. Stem cells are immature cells that produce all of the blood cells in your body: the white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that carry oxygen, and platelets that clot to stop you from bleeding. Your stem cells are constantly dividing and changing into the different types of blood cells in your body&mdash;replacing older blood cells. Some stem cells also circulate in your bloodstream.

You'll hear your transplant referred to as a "bone marrow transplant" or a "stem cell transplant." Technically, stem cell transplant is the more correct term, as you'll be receiving an infusion of stem cells. 

### Autologous Stem Cell Transplant
An autologous stem cell transplant is being recommended for you because, while you have cancer, you are in relatively good health and your doctors feel that a transplant is the best treatment for your specific disease.

Autologous means "from yourself." When you have an autologous stem cell transplant, your stem cells are harvested from your body and then frozen before you receive chemotherapy. You will receive a very high-dose of chemotherapy to kill the cancer in your body. This chemotherapy will also destroy most of the blood cells in your bone marrow and bloodstream. 

Collecting your stem cells beforehand allows us to give you a high-dose of chemotherapy before returning your stem cells to you. Once your stem cells have been given back to you, they will slowly start to make new blood cells. You are literally receiving a stem cell transplant "from yourself."

An autologous transplant has 3 key phases:

**Before** - You will prepare for your stem cell transplant. You will receive medications that stimulate your body to make more stem cells than normal and encourage those stem cells to circulate in your bloodstream. Your stem cells will be harvested from your bloodstream and then stored. A central venous catheter will be inserted into your upper chest wall. 

<figure>
<img src="/g/figs/opbmt_fig_chemo.jpg" /><figcaption>A patient receiving chemotherapy through their catheter.</figcaption>
</figure>

**During** - You will receive your chemotherapy, which is called the "conditioning regimen," to kill the cancer cells. Your stem cells and other blood cells will also be killed and you will lose your ability to make new blood cells. Your immune system will be severely compromised. Your stem cells will be taken from storage and infused into your body through your catheter. This is your stem cell transplant.

**After** - The infused stem cells find their way through your bloodstream to your bones. Over time, they take hold in your bones, a process called "engraftment." They begin to divide and create healthy, new blood cells. Your immune and vital systems begin to return to normal.

### Outpatient Autologous Stem Cell Transplant
Depending on your condition and treatment you may receive part of your care in the hospital as an inpatient and part of it in the BMT clinic as an outpatient. While you're being cared for in the outpatient setting, you will stay in a local hotel or apartment. You will only be admitted to the hospital if you develop complications. 

While each patient's transplant is different, here is a typical timeline for someone having an outpatient transplant. You'll see that the days leading up to the transplant are given minus numbers such as Day −3, Day −2, etc. The day of the transplant is Day 0, and the days that follow are Day +1, Day +2 etc. Your healthcare team will use this format when they explain your transplant to you. 

* **Day −4:** You and your caregiver will check into a hotel or apartment close to MSKCC's main hospital in Manhattan. 
* **Day −3:** You and your caregiver will come to MSKCC's Interventional Radiology Department at the main hospital, where a central venous catheter will be inserted in your upper chest wall. You will return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.
* **Day −2:** You will come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic where you will receive your chemotherapy. You will return to your hotel or apartment in the evening. (Note that, in some cases, patients will need multiple days of chemotherapy. Your healthcare team will explain your specific treatment plan to you.) 
* **Day −1:** This is a rest day. You will come to the outpatient clinic for evaluation.
* **Day 0:** This is your transplant day. You will come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic where you will receive your stem cell transplant. You will return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.
* **Day +1 to +12:** You will visit the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day to have blood work done, your vital signs checked, and a physical examination. You'll also receive hydration, electrolytes, and transfusions if necessary. While you are in the outpatient clinic, you will be cared for in a private room that has a bed and bathroom. There is a bedside entertainment unit with a TV and a computer. A light breakfast and lunch will be provided for you. There is a communal lounge with coffee and tea for caregivers. You will return to your hotel or apartment each evening. 

After your counts have recovered and you to not require frequent treatments, your central venous catheter will be removed. If you live within 1 hour of MSKCC's main hospital, you may be allowed to return home. If you live further away, you will stay at your local hotel or apartment for a few more weeks. You will still visit the Outpatient BMT Clinic regularly. 

## Your Transplant Team
A team of healthcare professionals from the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service will care for you throughout your treatment. Below, you'll find a list of the team members and their roles. You will meet each member of your healthcare team at different times during your treatment.

Your **attending doctor** will be in charge of your care throughout your treatment. Even though 1 specific doctor will be your primary doctor, you'll be cared for by different doctors during your transplant.

A **fellow** is a doctor who has completed general training and is receiving additional training in cancer care. 

A **nurse practitioner (NP)** is a nurse who has a master's or doctoral degree. An NP is licensed to examine you, provide medical treatments, and prescribe medications. The NPs will be responsible for your daily care when you come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic.

Your **BMT nurse coordinator** is a nurse who will communicate and work with you, your caregiver, and your team of doctors to organize and schedule all the testing, procedures, and consults with other professionals required prior to your transplant. Your nurse coordinator will give you calendars that show your treatment plan over time.

A team of **nurses** will provide your day-to-day nursing care. They are registered nurses specially trained in the care of stem cell transplant patients.

A **hospitalist** is a doctor who only sees patients while they are in the hospital. At MSKCC, a hospitalist is on duty all night. 

A **clinical pharmacist** specializes in the care of transplant patients. Your pharmacist will review your medications with you and your caregiver, teaching you how to take them properly, and to inform you of any side effects they may cause. Your pharmacist will review and monitor your medications frequently with the outpatient team.

**A social worker** will help you, your family, and those around you manage the stress that comes with the transplant process. The social workers understand the issues faced by transplant patients and are on hand to listen, offer counseling, and refer you or your family to other resources and services as needed. 

**House staff** are doctors who are completing their residency. They work under the supervision of the fellows and attending doctors.

**Financial counselors** from Patient Financial Services will work with you and your insurance company to determine your transplant benefits. These counselors are experienced in the insurance issues faced by transplant patients. Each insurance company and their policies differ, so when your insurance company requires authorization your financial counselor will assist with that process. 

**Session assistants** check-in patients and monitor patient flow in and out of the clinic. They assist doctors and NPs, schedule appointments, manage medical records, and track each patient's daily progress. This includes any scans, tests, and treatments given.

**Physician office assistants** provide administrative support to attending staff. You may speak with this person when you submit information or when you have questions for your physician.

While you are here, you will come to know all of the members of your team.

## Phase 1 - Before Your Transplant
Phase 1 of your treatment begins when you meet your healthcare team on or around Day −30 and continues until the start of your chemotherapy.

### Phase 1 - Summary and Checklist
In this phase, you'll make preparations for your transplant: practically, physically, and emotionally. This will be a very busy time for you and your family. 

Here is a list of things that will happen, and things that you need to do, in Phase 1. You can check off items as you go along:

* **Meet your team** - Meet your doctor and members of your healthcare team. Take this time to ask about your treatment and have them answer your questions.
* **Learn about your transplant** - Read this entire guide at least once, along with the additional information at the back. 
* **Make a list of questions** - Make a note of anything that you don't understand about your transplant, anything in the guide that isn't clear, and any other questions you have.
* **Choose a caregiver** - Identify a family member or friend to act as your caregiver. Make sure they understand what the role entails and give them a copy of this guide. Ask them to read this guide at least once.
* **Get financial clearance** - Meet with a representative from patient financial services (PFS) and speak to your health insurance company. Check that your outpatient stem cell transplant and medications are covered.
* **Make decisions about your fertility** - Speak with your healthcare team about your fertility options. Make an appointment with a fertility specialist to discuss the impact of your treatment on your ability to have children in the future. Take steps to preserve your fertility.
* **Speak to your children about your treatment** - Speak to your children about your treatment to help build trust and their sense of security.
* **Arrange childcare** - Your children cannot stay with you at your hotel or apartment during your outpatient transplant, so you should arrange for childcare.
* **Arrange pet care** - Your pets cannot stay with you during your transplant, so make arrangements for them.
* **Attend orientation** - You and your caregiver will attend the virtual orientation for outpatient autologous stem cell transplant patients. Ask your nurse coordinator for details.
* **Pretransplant evaluation** - You'll undergo a series of medical tests. Your nurse coordinator will schedule these tests with you.
* **Lodging** - Your nurse coordinator will make arrangements for you to stay at a local hotel or apartment and will give you details.
* **Nutrition consult** - Meet with a dietitian to review special dietary requirements and safe food handling.
* **Social work consult** - Meet with a social worker who will explain the psychological, emotional, and financial support services offered by the social work team.
* **Mobilization** - You will give yourself injections of a medication to increase the number of stem cells in your bloodstream.
* **Harvesting** - You will visit our Blood Donor Room and your stem cells will be harvested from your bloodstream.
* **Have your catheter inserted** - You will visit the Interventional Radiology Department and a central venous catheter will be inserted into your chest wall.
* **Learn catheter care** - A nurse will show you and your caregiver how to care for your catheter and change your bandages.
* **Make decisions about your hair** - Think about whether you'd like to cut your hair. Visit a wig store if you decide to wear a wig.
* **Prepare for clinic visits** - Purchase a tote bag or rolling case to carry your supplies to the Outpatient BMT Clinic every day.

### Meeting Your Team
On or around Day −30, you'll meet with your attending physician and other members of your healthcare team. Your attending physician will explain the type of treatment you'll undergo and will walk you through your likely treatment plan. The treatment plan is the specific plan for your treatment that takes into account your disease, overall health, and other factors. Your healthcare team will update your treatment plan as you undergo pretransplant tests.	

### Choosing Your Caregiver
One of the most important steps in preparing for your transplant is choosing your caregiver. This person is usually a family member or a close friend and will be an important part of your healthcare team. Your caregiver will be responsible for a lot of the day-to-day medical, practical, and emotional support you need during your outpatient transplant. 

Your caregiver will receive specific instructions from your healthcare team about their responsibilities. Some of these responsibilities will include: 

#### Medical support 
* Gathering information from your healthcare team
* Caring for your catheter 
* Making sure you take your medications and keeping a written record of when you take them
* Taking your temperature every 4 hours while you are awake, and away from the clinic. Keeping a written record of your temperature
* Keeping a written record of how much fluid you drink every day
* Noticing any changes in your condition
* Telling your healthcare team about any new symptoms you may have or changes in your condition
* Calling for medical help in an emergency

#### Practical support
* Dealing with financial and insurance issues 
* Preparing your meals according to a low-microbial diet
* Bringing you to and from the hospital
* Maintaining a clean environment in your hotel, apartment, or house
* Keeping family members and friends up to date about your condition
* Managing the number of visitors you have and keeping you away from anyone who is sick

#### Emotional support
* Paying attention to your moods and feelings
* Communicating with you and listening to you
* Understanding your needs and your decisions

#### Choosing the right caregiver
Being a caregiver is a full-time, 24-hour, 7-day a week responsibility. It is tiring, demanding, and stressful&mdash;especially if your condition, schedule or treatment changes. 

While you're undergoing your transplant, your caregiver will not be able to work and will need to stay with you for most of the day and night (however, while you are in the Outpatient BMT Clinic your caregiver can take some time for themselves; this is something we strongly recommend).

It is important for your caregiver to maintain a positive attitude, calm demeanor, and flexible approach while also providing you with the support and encouragement you need. It's important for you to understand that the caregiver role is challenging and that your caregiver might find themselves overwhelmed by the responsibilities at times.

Take time now to think about who you would like to be your caregiver. It should be somebody you trust who can take the time to care for you. Your caregiver should be someone who can offer you the practical and emotional support you need. 

#### Multiple caregivers
If there isn't 1 person who can act as your caregiver, then it may be possible for you to have different caregivers scheduled during different times. It is best to limit the number of caregivers to 1 or 2 individuals. 

#### Resources for caregivers
Talk to your healthcare team about choosing a caregiver. We have included useful resources for caregivers at the back of this guide.

### Financial Clearance
Stem cell transplants are complex and expensive. You will need to check that your pretransplant tests, high-dose chemotherapy, stem cell infusion, post-transplant care, housing, medications, and other expenses are covered by your insurance plan. If they are, then you will be "financially cleared" to begin treatment. 

Early on in your journey with us, you will meet with a representative from MSKCC's Patient Financial Services Department who will be your financial counselor. Your financial counselor will gather information about your treatment plan and will coordinate with your insurance company to check what aspects of your care are and are not covered. He or she will be available to answer questions about your medical expenses and bills throughout your treatment.

### Pretransplant Medical Evaluation 
Before you become a transplant candidate, your overall physical condition needs to be evaluated. You will need to make several trips to MSKCC to undergo tests. We often refer to this as the "work-up" or "restaging" period. During the work-up, you will need to have some or all of the following tests done:

* **A chest x-ray** - This is done to ensure your lungs are clear and there is no evidence of pneumonia or other problems.
* **Blood tests** - These are done to evaluate your kidney and liver function and to assess your white blood cell, hemoglobin, and platelet counts. Your past exposure to certain viruses is also checked.
* **Urine tests**
* **Electrocardiogram (EKG)** or **echocardiogram** - These are done to give your healthcare team information about your heart.
* **Pulmonary function tests** (PFT's) - These are breathing tests that measure your lung function.
* **Computerized axial tomography (CT) scan** - This is an x-ray that provides images of soft tissue and bone. Some scans use contrast dye that you drink or have injected into your body. Tell your doctor if you have a known allergy to contrast dye, or seafood or iodine. If you have an allergy, you may need to be given medications to prevent a reaction to the dye before your scan.
* **Dental exam** - You must have a full dental exam. Any cavities, loose fillings, or gum disease should be taken care of before your transplant. You can have these done by your own dentist or you can see our dentist. If you see your own dentist, please ask them to provide a note saying that you have no dental problems. If there are issues, please ask the dentist to contact the MSKCC dentist.
* **Positron emission tomography (PET) scan** – This is a scan that is used to look at your organs and they way they function in your body.
* **Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy** - A bone marrow aspirate is a small sample of bone marrow, usually taken from the back of your hip. Your hip will be numbed, a needle will be inserted into the bone marrow, and a small amount of bone marrow liquid will be taken out. A bone marrow biopsy will be performed at the same time as your bone marrow aspiration. The biopsy involves collecting a tiny piece of bone for examination. This procedure is done to evaluate how well your bone marrow is producing cells and to check for any sign of cancer in the marrow.
* **Skeletal survey** - This is an x-ray of the major bones in your body that is done to check for any signs of disease. This can take a few hours to complete.

These tests are usually done in the 30 days before your transplant (Day −30 onwards), but sometimes the pretransplant evaluation can take longer. Your nurse coordinator will work with you and your caregiver to schedule the tests.

The results of the tests will be used to plan your treatment and adjust it to your specific needs. All the testing needs to be reviewed to make sure that it is safe to start your treatment.

Your doctor and nurse will explain any other tests that you may need.

### Making Decisions About Your Fertility
Your cancer treatment will affect your fertility. It is likely that you will not be able to conceive a child naturally after high-dose chemotherapy. 

In some cases, it's possible to take  steps to preserve your fertility before you undergo treatment. Women can bank eggs or embryos and men can bank sperm. These steps may allow you to conceive in the future. If you have received chemotherapy in the past, there is a risk that your sperm or eggs have already been damaged so preserving your fertility may not be an option. 

We have summarized the most common steps that people take to preserve their fertility before undergoing a stem cell transplant. If you want to learn more about fertility preservation options and other ways you might build a family after your transplant, ask your doctor or nurse for a referral to a fertility expert.

##### Options for men
Men can freeze sperm before treatment. The first step is to schedule an appointment at a sperm bank, where you will masturbate and collect your ejaculated fluid in a sterile cup. 

The sperm bank will analyze the specimen to be sure there are healthy sperm to freeze. The semen is then placed in vials and frozen. It can be stored for as long as you want, even for many years. We recommend that men collect 3 separate specimens if possible, abstaining from sex for 2 to 5 days before the first collection and between the other collections.

For more information, please read the guides *Sperm Banking* and *Cancer and Fertility: Information for Men* included at the back of this guide. These guides are also available online:

* [Sperm Banking http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/899.pdf](http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/899.pdf)
* [Cancer and Fertility: Information for Men http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/713.pdf](http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/713.pdf)

##### Options for women
Women can freeze eggs or embryos before treatment. The first step is to schedule an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist (a doctor with special training in fertility). Ask your doctor or a member of your healthcare team to refer you to a reproductive endocrinologist. 

Your reproductive endocrinologist will evaluate your fertility and will give you advice on how best to proceed. 

If these tests show you can be successful in collecting eggs, on or around the first day of your period you will start giving yourself daily hormone injections. This medication will stimulate some of the eggs in your ovaries to mature. You will need to take the injections for about 10 days, during which you will be closely monitored by your reproductive endocrinologist. Once the eggs are fully mature, you will be scheduled for the egg retrieval. This is an outpatient procedure done using anesthesia, so you will be asleep. Your eggs will be collected using a very thin needle passed through the wall of your vagina.

If you are going to store embryos, your eggs will be fertilized with sperm in the laboratory before freezing. This is called in-vitro fertilization (IVF). If you are going to store eggs, they are not fertilized with sperm before freezing. The frozen eggs or embryos can be stored for as long as you want, even for many years.

Another possible option to preserve fertility is ovarian tissue freezing. However, this is experimental.

For more information please read the guides *Cancer and Fertility: Information for Women* and *Selecting a Reproductive Endocrinologist* included at the back of this guide. These guides are also available online:

* [Cancer and Fertility: Information for Women http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/725.pdf](http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/725.pdf)
* [Selecting a Reproductive Endocrinologist http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/739.pdf](http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/739.pdf)

##### Financial issues related to fertility preservation
Unfortunately, fertility preservation is not covered by most insurance plans. Sperm banking can cost up to about $1000 and egg or embryo freezing can cost $10,000 to $15,000. There are also annual storage fees. 

The financial staff at the sperm bank and your reproductive endocrinologist will contact your insurance company to determine if you have coverage. 

There are financial assistance programs available, including Fertile Hope, a discount program for eligible patients managed by Livestrong. For more information about this, ask your nurse or a member of your healthcare team for an application or go to the Fertile Hope Website at [http://www.fertilehope.org/](http://www.fertilehope.org/).

### Speaking to Your Children About Your Transplant
Being open with your child helps to build trust and a sense of security. During your transplant, your children will not be able to stay with you at your hotel or apartment. This can be upsetting for parents and children, so clear communication is recommended. When speaking to your children about your transplant, we recommend that you:

* Always take into consideration your child’s age, developmental stage, and individual personality when talking about your illness and transplant.
* Use the proper names and terms ("bump" or "boo boo" are confusing) when describing your diagnosis and transplant.
Prepare your child for changes in your appearance, energy level, and daily routine (e.g., not going to work and multiple medical appointments).
* Be cautious about making promises that you will be home by an exact date (as discharges can be delayed for various reasons).
* Invite your child to ask any and all questions. Remember, it is okay not to have all the answers.
* Validate and accept your child's feelings.
* Reassure your child that he or she is not responsible for your illness and that cancer is not contagious.
* Set aside family time in which the transplant is not the only focus.  

### Making Arrangements for Childcare
Your children will not be able to stay with you during your outpatient transplant. Before you move into the local apartment or hotel, and undergo your transplant, you will need to make arrangements to have your children taken care of. We recommend that you:

* Identify family members or friends who knows your child well to care for them during the transplant period.
* Maintain your child's daily routine as much as possible.
* Prepare your child for these changes and help him or her weather the transition.
* Expect that your child may have some reactions or may show normal signs of adjustment during the transition.
* Engage your child’s teachers, counselors, clergy, and other adults involved in their life to support them during this time.
* Educate your child’s caregiver about the transplant process in case your child has questions during the separation.

We have suggested ways for you to maintain a strong connection to your children while you are living at the local hotel or apartment later in this guide under "Living With Neutropenia."

For more assistance related to childcare, contact your social worker. 

### Making Arrangements for Your Pets
Animals can carry diseases and may present risks to you while your immune system is compromised. During your transplant period (chemotherapy through recovery), you should minimize direct contact with animals. Your pets will not be able to stay with you at the hotel or apartment, so you should arrange for them to be cared for while you are away from home.

You should also take the following precautions:

* Be sure that your pet is up to date with immunizations and any booster shots. Have your veterinarian check your pet's stool for parasites.
* Have your pet treated for fleas. If your pet walks through wooded areas, have it screened for ticks.
* If you do come into contact with your pets, do not allow them to sleep with you. Do not allow your pets to lick you in the face.
* Protect yourself from bites or scratches.
* Do not clean cat litter boxes or clean up after your dog in the street. Have someone else do these things for you. 
* Avoid all contact with birds, lizards, snakes, turtles, iguanas, exotic pets, hamsters, or other rodents while you recover. Contact with bird or reptile waste may expose you to certain infectious germs.

After you have recovered from your transplant, you will be given additional instructions on pet care in the *Returning Home After Your Autologous Transplant* guide included at the back of this guide.

### Moving into a Nearby Apartment or Hotel
For the duration of your outpatient treatment, you and your caregiver will stay at a hotel or apartment within walking distance of the Outpatient BMT Clinic at the main hospital. 

You and your caregiver will make regular visits to the clinic. 
Your lodging arrangements will be made and communicated to you by your nurse coordinator. 

### Mobilization and Harvesting
In an autologous transplant, your stem cells are first mobilized and then harvested (also called "collected") from your body before you receive chemotherapy. 

Mobilization is the process of increasing the number of stem cells produced by your bone marrow and released into your bloodstream. 

Stem cell harvesting is the process of collecting and separating whole blood into its major components (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma) then removing stem cells from the white blood cell component.

Once your stem cells have been harvested, they are frozen and stored, then infused into your body after your chemotherapy; this is your stem cell transplant.

#### Mobilization
Normally, your stem cells live in your bone marrow, where they are difficult to access and collect for transplantation (although a few circulate in your bloodstream). 

To increase the amount of stem cells in your bloodstream, you'll be given injections of a medication called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF). GCSF stimulates your body to make more stem cells than usual and encourages them to move into your bloodstream, where they can be collected much more easily. This process is called mobilization. GCSF drugs include filgrastim (Neupogen<sup>&reg;</sup>), pegfilgrastim (Neulasta<sup>&reg;</sup>) and plerixafor (Mozobil<sup>&reg;</sup>). 

In most cases, GCSF injections are self-administered, meaning that you will inject yourself with the medication at home. You'll be given GCSF in prefilled syringes, which you'll keep in your refrigerator. Your nurse coordinator will create a personal mobilization calendar for you, which will tell you when to give yourself the injections. The number of injections needed will depend on a number of factors, including your weight.

A full guide to giving yourself GCSF injections is covered in the document *Directions for Giving an Injection Below the Skin with Neupogen<sup>&reg;</sup> (Filgrastim) or Neulasta<sup>&reg;</sup> (pegfilgrastim) in a Pre-Filled Syringe* which is included at the back of this guide. Your NP will talk you through this information as well. 

Some patients will not give themselves injections of filgrastim or pegfilgrastim, and will instead be given a different type of GCSF called plerixafor. If plerixafor is recommended for you, then the injections will be given by a nurse in the BMT clinic.

</figure>

The GCSF injections will stimulate the growth and mobilization of your stem cells, then they will be harvested. Harvesting is the procedure used to collect some of these stem cells in your blood. 

Before you are scheduled for stem cell harvesting, a nurse or doctor will examine your veins to see if they are okay for the procedure. If your veins are not healthy enough, arrangements will be made to have a catheter inserted, which will then be used during harvesting to collect the stem cells. The catheter will remain in place for several weeks, or months.

The harvesting procedure is done in the Blood Donor Room. Your nurse coordinator or your doctor will schedule 3 to 5 harvesting sessions to collect enough cells. The exact number of sessions is determined by the number of stem cells that are collected in each session. You will be notified each day if you need to return for another harvesting session. Each session will last 3 to 4 hours.

You should eat dairy products or other foods that are rich in calcium the night before and the morning of your harvesting session. Wear comfortable clothes. 

During the procedure you will be laying down in a bed or sitting in a reclining chair. You will be connected to a machine by IV tubes connected to veins in your arms or your catheter. Blood will be withdrawn through the IV line or catheter and circulated through the machine where your stem cells will be collected. The rest of your blood will be returned to you. 

If you wish, you will be able to watch TV or read during your procedure. A family member or friend may sit with you. Since patients sometimes complain of feeling cold during the procedure, blankets will be available.

After your harvesting procedure is done, a bandage will be applied to your arm to prevent bleeding. It should remain in place for at least 3 hours, but not more than 5 hours. If your catheter was used, then it will be flushed and recapped. 

Your stem cells will be brought to our stem cell laboratory where they'll be frozen and stored safely until your transplant day.

After harvesting most patients have minimal side effects and can resume their regular activities. The most common side effects are:

* Fatigue
* A low platelet count
* Numbness or tingling in the lips, hands, or feet caused by a temporary decrease in the calcium levels in your blood

Call your doctor if you:

* Develop a temperature of 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher
* Develop flu-like symptoms or 
* Notice any redness, bleeding, drainage, or pain at your catheter or needle insertion site
* Notice any bleeding or bruising
* Notice numbness or tingling of your lips, hands, or feet

### Having Your Central Venous Catheter Inserted
Prior to starting your conditioning treatment, you and your caregiver will come to MSKCC's Interventional Radiology Department at the main hospital to have a central venous catheter inserted into the wall of your chest. 

A central venous catheter is a tube that is inserted into a large vein near your collarbone. On the outside of your body, the catheter divides into 2 or 3 smaller tubes called lumens. 

A central venous catheter allows your healthcare team to give you medication, fluids, electrolytes, blood transfusions, and chemotherapy without having to keep sticking you repeatedly with a needle. Having a catheter will make your treatment much more comfortable. 

The catheter will stay in your body throughout your treatment and is usually removed 2 to 3 weeks after you receive your stem cell transplant.

#### Before Your Catheter is Inserted
Your nurse coordinator will work with you to schedule the insertion of your catheter. 

In the days leading up to the insertion of your catheter, do not take aspirin, any products that contain aspirin, or vitamin E. You should also tell your doctor if you are taking any blood thinners or any medication for diabetes.

In the days leading up to the insertion of your catheter, you should call your doctor if you develop any illness. This includes a fever, cold, flu, or sore throat.

If you have been told to be on a clear liquid diet before your catheter is inserted, do not eat any solid food after midnight the night before your procedure. Continue to drink clear liquids up to 2 hours before you arrive at the hospital for your procedure. Your healthcare team will let you know if this applies to you.

#### The day your catheter is inserted
Your catheter will be inserted at our Surgical Day Hospital (SDH). You will probably already be staying in a hotel or apartment within walking distance of MSKCC's main hospital. If you are not already living locally, you should arrange transportation between your lodging and the SDH.  

On the morning of your procedure, you may shower, but do not apply any creams or lotions to your body. Take any medications you've been instructed to take. 

If you wear contact lenses, you should wear glasses on the day your catheter is inserted. If you don't own glasses, then bring a container for your contact lenses to the hospital with you. 

You and your caregiver should leave all valuables, including jewelry, at home. Bring only your medications and the money you need for the day to the hospital. 

You should report to the SDH several hours before your procedure is scheduled to take place. This will allow your medical team to evaluate you and make sure everything is in order before they insert your catheter.

Enter the hospital through the main entrance at 1275 York Avenue. Take the M elevators at the top of the escalator to the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor. As you step off the elevator, enter the double doors to the SDH. Check in at the desk. Please arrive on time.

You will change into a gown, robe, and slippers. When you are ready, you will be taken to the Interventional Radiology Department.

#### The Procedure
<figure>
<img src="/g/figs/opbmt_fig_cvc.jpg" />
<figcaption>A small area of your chest will be numbed. 1 or 2 small incisions will be made and your catheter will be inserted.</figcaption>
</figure>

The placement of your catheter should take about 30 minutes. First, an IV line will be started and you will be given medication through the line to make you sleepy. Your blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and oxygen levels will be monitored during your procedure.

A small area near your collarbone will be numbed with a local anesthetic. Depending on the type of catheter recommended for you, either 1 or 2 small incisions (surgical cuts) will be made near your collarbone, usually at the base of your neck. These incisions will be used to gain access to a vein where the catheter will be inserted. 

Once your catheter has been inserted into your chest, the incisions near it will be stitched closed. Your body will absorb your stitches. They will not need to be removed. The outside of your incision will be covered with strips of adhesive tape. Your catheter will be stitched to your skin at the point where it exits your body so that it will stay in position. You will be able to see this thread around your catheter. 
<figure>
<img src="/g/figs/opbmt_fig_cvcinplace.jpg" />
<figcaption>Once the catheter has been inserted, it will exit your chest wall and split into a number of lumens&mdash;tubes that allow your medical team to access your blood, give you fluids, infusions, etc.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### After your catheter has been inserted
After your catheter has been inserted, you will be monitored in the SDH for 2 to 3 hours before being allowed to return to your hotel or apartment. 

You will need to leave the bandages covering the incision near your collarbone in place and dry for 48 hours. After 2 days you can remove these bandages and leave the site of the incision open to the air. The strips of adhesive tape that cover the incision should be left in place until they start to peel off. This should happen about 3 to 5 days after your catheter is inserted.

The point where the catheter exits your skin will still need to be covered with a bandage. The stitch at this site keeps your catheter in place until the cuff becomes fully anchored.

If you have discomfort at your incision sites or around the cuff, ask your nurse for medication to relieve your pain.

#### Taking care of your catheter
Taking good care of your catheter is important. When you visit the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day your nurse will change your catheter bandages, change the caps on the lumens, and flush your catheter. When you are in your hotel, apartment, or home (and anywhere else away from the BMT clinic) you are responsible for caring for your catheter.

A nurse will teach you how to care for your catheter. You will learn how to change the bandage while ensuring that it remains free from germs; this is known as "sterile technique." Using sterile technique will decrease your risk of infection. Your caregiver will learn how to change your bandage with you.

Your nurse will also give you supplies, including clean bandages, gauze pads, lumen caps, tape, clamps, and other essentials. 

Your catheter should not interfere with your day-to-day activities as you get ready for your transplant, but you should avoid strenuous activities and contact sports. 

Prepare the following emergency kit and keep it with you at all times: 

* Two catheter caps
* One toothless clamp
* Alcohol swabs
* One roll of 2-inch tape
* Two 2 &times; 2 gauze pads
* Your doctor's office and emergency telephone numbers.

Here is a summary of the things you'll do to take care of your catheter:

* Change the Tegaderm<sup>&reg;</sup> dressing once a week.
* Change the caps on the lumens and flush your catheter twice a week.
* Use the small white clamps on each lumen of the catheter to clamp the catheter closed when it is not in use.
* Use a waterproof cover, called an Aquaquard<sup>&reg;</sup>, over your catheter when showering or bathing.
* Avoid submerging your catheter in water (e.g., in a swimming pool or hot tub).
* Keep your catheter secure. Avoid pulling on it or the lumens.
* Tape the lumens to your skin, pin them to your clothing, or tape them to your bra if you're a woman. 

#### Problems With Your Catheter
You and your caregiver should be on the lookout for any problems with your catheter. Infection is the most serious complication to watch out for. Look at your catheter site daily. Notify your doctor, NP, or nurse if you experience any of the following:

* Redness, swelling, and/or drainage (a liquid that can vary in color but may be clear, bloody, or green/yellowish) at the exit site
* Pain or tenderness at the site where your catheter is inserted into your chest
* Temperature of 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher
* Flu-like symptoms or chills

Other complications may be related to the catheter itself. Notify your doctor, NP, or nurse if you experience any of the following:

* A hole or break in the catheter
* Swelling in your face, neck, or arm, on the same side of your body as your catheter

<figure class="invisible"><img src="/g/figs/opbmt_fig_clampedcvc.jpg" /><figcaption>Clamping the catheter above a leak.</figcaption></figure>

If your catheter is leaking at any time, clamp it above the leak. Use the white catheter clamp on the catheter, if possible. Wipe the area that is leaking with an alcohol pad and then cover the leak with tape. Follow the instructions in your *BMT Emergency Guide* (included at the back of this guide); if it is between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm call the BMT Outpatient Clinic. If it is after 8:00 pm call your attending physician or go directly to the Urgent Care Center.

Full instructions on how to care for your catheter are included in *Caring for Your Central Venous Catheter* which is included at the end of this guide. You should read it in full and refer to it when you are changing your bandages or caring for your catheter.

## Phase 2 - Your Chemotherapy and Transplant

### Phase 2 - Summary and Checklist
There are 2 main activities in this second phase of your journey. You'll receive your high-dose chemotherapy, and on Day 0 your stem cells will be taken from storage and infused back into your body through your catheter. 

These are the key things that will happen during this phase:

* **Outpatient BMT Clinic** - You'll start making daily visits to the outpatient BMT clinic.
* **Conditioning regimen** - You'll receive high-dose chemotherapy to kill your cancer. The chemotherapy will also kill the cells in your blood and damage your immune system. 
* **Learn about side effects** - The side effects of chemotherapy are significant. Take time to learn about the side effects you'll experience by reading this guide in full along with accompanying information.
* **Monitoring temperature and fluid intake** - Your caregiver will take your temperature every 4 hours and will monitor how much you drink. Your caregiver will record this information in a diary. Your healthcare team will check this information when you and your caregiver come to the clinic.
* **Learn about sexuality and transplantation** - Learn about the impact that treatment and transplantation can have on your sexuality.
* **Rest day (Day −1)** - You'll come to the clinic for an evaluation.
* **Transplantation (Day 0)** - You'll visit the clinic. Your stem cells will be taken from storage and thawed. They will then be infused into your body through your catheter. This is your transplant.

We cover each of these activities in detail later in this section.

### The Outpatient BMT Clinic
While you are being cared for on an outpatient basis, you will receive all your care, including your chemotherapy, transplant and post-transplant care, at the Outpatient BMT Clinic. The clinic is located on the 4<sup>th</sup> floor of the main hospital. You'll make daily visits to the clinic, and will only be admitted to the inpatient BMT unit if you need more care than can be provided to you in the outpatient clinic.  

In the morning when you come to the clinic, you should wear everyday, comfortable clothing that allows for easy access to your catheter (e.g., shirts that open at the front, sweatshirts, and large t-shirts). Avoid wearing clothing that is too difficult to take off or put back on again. 

You should bring these items to the clinic with you each day:

* A list of all prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking, along with with dosages and frequency. This should include patches, creams, vitamins, nutritional supplements, herbal products, and over-the-counter medications. 
* All the prescription medications you were instructed to take during the bone marrow transplant period
* Your temperature and oral intake diary. Your caregiver will use this to keep track of your temperature and fluid intake while you're away from the clinic. This will be explained later
* Books, newspapers, an audio player, a laptop or tablet computer&mdash;whatever you need to pass the time
* A notebook to write down key pieces of information and any questions you or your caregiver may have

You should arrive at the clinic at your scheduled time. Once you arrive, you'll check in with the session assistant and then you'll be brought to a private room. Your room will have a bed and bathroom. There is a bedside entertainment unit with a TV and a computer. A light breakfast and lunch will be provided for you.

Your NP will come to your room and will sit with you and your caregiver. Your NP will ask you series of questions about how you are feeling, and do a physical exam. Your nurse or a Patient Care Technician will check your vital signs and weight. Your NP will check your temperature and oral intake diary; the diary is explained later in this guide. 

Each day, some of your blood will be taken and sent for testing. Your blood will be checked to see how your white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets are recovering. Your blood will also be used to check the health of your kidneys, measure your electrolyte levels, and identify any signs of infection, such as the presence of harmful bacteria or viruses. 

Once you've been examined, you will wait in your room in the clinic for your test results to return. This can take several hours. This is a good time for your caregiver to take a break; he or she can take some personal time or run errands. You will be safe in the care of your healthcare team. We highly recommend that caregivers leave the hospital and take this time to unwind.

After several hours, your test results (sometimes referred to as "labs") will come back from the lab. Your healthcare team will analyze the results and will make decisions about your care. The rest of your visit to the clinic that day will depend on your test results.

Here are some things that can happen based on your test results:

* You could be given fluids to hydrate you.
* You could be given an infusion of platelets, red blood cells, or other blood components.
* Your medication could be changed.
* Your treatment could be left as is.

All of this will be explained to you. You'll remain in the clinic until any actions the healthcare team have recommended have been completed. Once your healthcare team is happy, you'll be free to leave. You'll return to your apartment or hotel, where your caregiver will continue to monitor your temperature and fluid intake. 

### The Conditioning Regimen - Receiving Your Chemotherapy
The conditioning regimen is another name for the high-dose chemotherapy that you will receive prior to your transplant. The regimen you receive will depend upon your disease, previous treatments, and specific transplant protocol or treatment plan.

The conditioning regimen starts on a negative numbered day. Depending on your treatment plan, you may have 1 or multiple days of chemotherapy. Your stem cell transplant always takes place on Day 0. Remember that every day after transplant is referred to as a positive numbered day (e.g., Day +1, Day +2, etc). 

<table>
<tr><th class="tfive">Day −14 to Day −2</th><th class="tfive">Day -1</th><th class="tfive">Day 0</th><th class="tfive">Day +1</th></tr>
<tr><td>Conditioning regimen (chemotherapy)</td><td>Rest day</td><td>Stem cell infusion</td><td>Start of supportive care</td></tr>
</table>

Your nurse coordinator will work with you to plan your schedule, and will provide you with a treatment calendar. He or she will tell you the date and time of your treatment.

On the morning of your chemotherapy, you and your caregiver will make the first of your regular visits to the Outpatient BMT Clinic. 

Once you have checked in and been evaluated by your NP, you will meet with your clinical pharmacist. Your pharmacist will explain the medications you will take throughout your treatment and will show you how to use your pill box. Your pharmacist will give you all the medications that you will need to take, along with a list that tells you when to take each different medication.

Once you have been evaluated and your pharmacist has spoken to you about your medications, you'll receive your chemotherapy. Before you receive your chemotherapy, a number of safety checks will be done to make sure everything is correct. 

* Your chemotherapy is ordered by your doctor.
* A nurse checks your chemotherapy order.
* A pharmacist checks your chemotherapy order.
* A pharmacist checks your blood test results.
* Your chemotherapy is prepared in the pharmacy.
* A pharmacist performs a final check of your chemotherapy.
* Your chemotherapy is picked up by your chemotherapy nurse.
* Two chemotherapy nurses check to make sure your chemotherapy order, blood test results, and chemotherapy are correct.

Once all the safety checks have been completed, your nurse will give you fluids (to keep you hydrated), antinausea medication, and the chemotherapy medication through your catheter.

During your chemotherapy, your healthcare team will use this time to talk to you about the rest of your transplant journey. 

Your healthcare team will make sure that the logistics of the next few days are clear, including what happens on transplant day and what happens after your transplant. 

They will talk to you about the side effects you'll start to experience after your chemotherapy. You'll be given printed materials that explain these side effects in detail and you'll be shown what to do if you need to get help while you are in your apartment or hotel.

### Monitoring Your Temperature and Fluid Intake
From the time you start receiving your chemotherapy, your caregiver must take your temperature every 4 hours while you are away from the Outpatient BMT Clinic and monitor all of the fluids you drink. Your caregiver will write this information in the *Temperature and Oral Intake Diary*. A sample page from the diary is included at the back of this guide.

Your nurse will give your caregiver a thermometer and will show him or her how to use it. Your nurse will show both of you how to use the diary.

If your temperature is 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher, your caregiver needs follow the instructions on your BMT Emergency Guide; if it is between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm call the Outpatient BMT Clinic at (212) 639-2399. If it is after 8:00 pm call (212) 639-2000 and ask for the doctor covering bone marrow transplant.

You should drink 2 liters or 64 fluid ounces of fluids each day. Try to drink steadily throughout the day&mdash;little and often.

Your caregiver should bring the diary to the clinic each day. Your NP will review the diary with and your caregiver you each day at the clinic. 

### Rest Day 
The day between your chemotherapy and your transplant day is a rest day. This rest day allows the chemotherapy drug to work and then leave your body. When you receive your stem cells, there will be no trace of the chemotherapy drug in your body, so the transplanted stem cells will not be harmed.

On the rest day, you will come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic as usual, where you will be evaluated. Your healthcare team will also use the rest day to speak with you about your stem cell infusion, communicate important information, and teach you and your caregiver useful skills.

### Transplant Day
Now that you've received chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells in your body, it's time for your stem cell infusion&mdash;your transplant. 

On Day 0 of your specific treatment plan, the stem cells that were separated from your blood and frozen earlier will be re-infused into your body. These stem cells will give you back your ability to make new blood cells and fight infections. 

#### The morning before your transplant
On the morning of Day 0, your transplant day, you and your caregiver should come to the outpatient clinic as usual, at your scheduled time. Give yourself extra time to get to the clinic, as you may feel tired after your chemotherapy. 

#### Your stem cell infusion
Before the stem cell infusion, your frozen stem cells will be removed from storage in the stem cell laboratory and brought to your room. The stem cells are stored in clear plastic bags that look like a bag of blood. The bags will be placed in a warm water bath to thaw. 

You will be given medications about 30 minutes before your transplant to help reduce any side effects effects that you may experience during the infusion. 

Once the stem cells are thawed, your NP or doctor will infuse the stem cells into your body through your catheter. You will be closely monitored and your vital signs will be checked frequently during and after the infusion. 

You may experience some side effects during and after your infusion. The common side effects are nausea, vomiting, a tickle in your throat, or a cough. Other side effects that can occur include low blood pressure, chills, and fever. 

It's important that you communicate with your healthcare team and with your caregiver during your transplant. Let your healthcare team know how you're feeling and tell them if you experience any side effects. If you do experience side effects, your healthcare team will treat your symptoms. 

During and after your transplant, you may notice a strong, garlic-like taste in your mouth. Your urine, sweat, and skin may also have a garlic-like smell. You may not notice the smell but those around you will. This smell is caused by the preservative used to store your stem cells and will gradually go away over 1 to 2 days. The Nutrition Department will give you lemons to cut up and use as safe, natural air-fresheners. 

Your urine may appear bloody for 24 hours after your stem cells are infused into your body. This is your body's way of getting rid of the byproducts of the stem cells that are not needed.  

After your stem cells are infused through your catheter, you will remain in your hospital room for 4 to 6 hours for observation. After that, you will be allowed to return home to your hotel or apartment to rest. 

## Phase 3 - After Your Transplant
Now that you've had your transplant, you will enter a period of watching and waiting for your stem cells to begin producing new blood cells, a process called engraftment. 

As engraftment occurs, the number of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in your blood will return to normal. The amount of these cells, called your "counts," will be monitored daily. You will remain in a nearby apartment or hotel and will return to the outpatient clinic each day to have your progress evaluated and to have adjustments made to your treatment. 

### Phase 3 - Summary and Checklist
These are the key things that will happen during this phase:

* **Learn about engraftment** - The stem cells that have been re-infused into your body find their way to your bone marrow, fix in place, and begin to make new blood. This is called engraftment. You should read about this process and make a note of any questions you have.
* **Learn about chemotherapy side effects** - You may experience nausea and other side effects associated with your treatment and transplant. We've compiled a list of these side effects. Read this information and make a note of any questions you or your caregiver have. 
* **Return to the Outpatient BMT Clinic** - You will make daily visits to the clinic until your healthcare team tells you that you can come less often.
* **Testing** - You will undergo blood tests and other tests to monitor your progress. You will have blood drawn each time you return to the clinic.
* **Neutropenia** - The low number of white blood cells in your blood will leave you vulnerable to infection, so you will need to take precautions to avoid any sources of infection.
* **Low-microbial diet** - Because you are neutropenic, you will eat a diet that contains a low number of potentially harmful microbes.
* **Low platelet count** - The low number of platelets in your bloodstream will make you vulnerable to bruising and bleeding. You will need to take care to avoid causes of bleeding.
* **Personal care** - Because you are neutropenic and have a low platelet count, you will need to take special care when you bath, shower, and brush your teeth.
* **Low red blood cell count** - You will experience fatigue.
* **Transfusions** - You may need to receive a blood transfusion to boost the numbers of red blood cells and platelets in your bloodstream.
* **Recovery of your counts** - Over time, as your stem cells engraft and begin to produce new blood cells, your counts will improve.
* **Exercise** - You will try to remain physically active after your transplant by limiting the amount of time you spend in bed and walking a little each day.

We will cover each of these topics in detail later in this section.

### Engraftment
Engraftment is when your body accepts the transplant and your white blood cell count returns. 

Almost immediately after your stem cells are infused into your body, they will travel through your bloodstream into your bone marrow. Once the stem cells arrive in your bone marrow, they will begin to engraft. White blood cell engraftment usually occurs about 10 to 14 days following your transplant, but this may vary depending upon your disease and exact treatment. Platelets and red blood cells usually take a little longer to recover than white blood cells. 

Each day when you return to the Outpatient BMT Clinic, you will have blood drawn. This blood will be analyzed, and the different types of cells in your blood will be counted. When your stem cells engraft and start to divide, the number of white, red, and platelet cells will increase. 

During the time that you are waiting for engraftment, you may need to have blood and platelet transfusions. You'll be given injections of growth factor which is a medication that will speed up the production of white blood cells in your body. 

Remember, you will be very vulnerable to infection at this time. You will need to take precautions, including avoiding sources of infection, washing your hands regularly, and eating a low-microbial diet. You will be closely monitored for any signs of infections. 

When your cells start to engraft, you may experience bone pain or a rash on your body. These are common symptoms experienced during engraftment.

### Post Transplant Care At The Outpatient BMT Clinic
After your transplant, you will receive all your care in the Outpatient BMT Clinic&mdash;the same place where you had your chemotherapy and your transplant. Each morning, you will return to the clinic, just like you did on the mornings before chemotherapy and your transplant. 

### Side Effects From Chemotherapy
Your chemotherapy will kill the cancerous cells in your body and will prepare your bone marrow to receive your transplant. However, the side effects associated with chemotherapy are not to be taken lightly. These side effects may include the loss of your ability to fight infections, infertility, hair loss, fatigue, nausea, mouth sores, mouth tenderness, or mouth sores. 

Your healthcare team will help you understand and prepare for these side effects. Before you receive your chemotherapy, make a list of questions that you would like to ask about these side effects. Talk through these questions with your caregiver and your healthcare team. 

#### Neutropenia
Your chemotherapy will severely damage your ability to fight infections and heal. It's important that you understand why this happens, how to watch for danger signs, and how to avoid infections and injuries.

One side effect of chemotherapy is called neutropenia. Neutropenia is a condition in which you have a lower than normal number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in your bloodstream. Neutrophils play a crucial role in your immune system&mdash;they are one of the first types of cells that travel to the site of an infection. Once they reach the site of an infection, they ingest and fight potentially harmful microorganisms. 

Because your chemotherapy will kill your stem cells, you will lose your ability to make new neutrophils. Because your neutrophils are not being replaced, the number of neutrophils in your bloodstream will drop to a very low level, leaving you at high risk of infections. You and your caregiver will work together to watch for any sign of infection. You'll keep a record of your temperature, even when you are in your hotel or apartment, and you will have to take very careful precautions to avoid infections. 

#### Low platelet level (thrombocytopenia)
In addition to losing your ability to make neutrophils and other types of white blood cells, you'll also lose your ability to make platelets. Platelets clump together to help stop bleeding.  After your chemotherapy, the number of platelets in your bloodstream will be very low, a condition called thrombocytopenia. 

You will need to take special care to avoid cuts and strenuous activities that might cause bleeding. You need to take special care of your gums and mouth because it's common for bleeding to happen there. 

After your transplant your healthcare team will take samples of your blood each day to count the number of neutrophils and platelets in your bloodstream. 

As your stem cells take hold and start to make new blood cells, the number of neutrophils in your bloodstream (sometimes referred to as your absolute neutrophil count or ANC) will increase, as will your number of platelets (called your platelet count). All together, these are known as "your counts" and they are key signs that your transplant has worked. You'll hear the term counts used frequently by your healthcare team. 

More indepth guides to living with neutropenia and low platelet levels are included later in this guide under "Phase 3: After Your Transplant".

#### Fatigue
After your chemotherapy, the number of red blood cells in your blood will be very low. 

Red blood cells are the cells that transport oxygen around your body. Because the number of red blood cells in your blood will be low, oxygen will not travel around your body as easily as before. This will mean that you will feel tired. Your caregiver will need to help you carry out day-to-day activities until your red blood cell count returns to normal. Don't be afraid to ask for help, even with things you used to do with ease.

Even though you will feel tired after your chemotherapy and your transplant, you should still try to remain active. 

#### Nausea and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting are common side effects of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy acts on a specific part of your brain that may trigger nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can also be caused by stress or just the thought of having chemotherapy. The amount of nausea and vomiting you have will depend on your past experience and the type of chemotherapy you will receive. Sometimes, you may experience nausea during your chemotherapy treatment, or it may be delayed for several hours or days. It is important to manage nausea because it can keep you from eating and drinking.

You will be given medication to prevent and control nausea prior to receiving chemotherapy. You will also be given a prescription for antinausea medication to take home with you. These medications work differently for each person. If the medication you are taking isn't helping, tell your NP or doctor. You may need to try a different medication or take more than 1 kind of antinausea medication to feel better. Your healthcare team will work with you to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting.

#### Diarrhea
Diarrhea is frequent, loose, watery bowel movements. It can also cause stomach cramps, gas, and pain in the stomach or rectal area. Diarrhea can be caused by cancer treatments, medications, infection, stress, or other medical conditions. If you are having diarrhea, you can become dehydrated due to loss of fluids and electrolytes. If your diarrhea continues for more than 24 hours, call your doctor or NP. Medications are available to treat diarrhea but do not take any over-the-counter medication until you have been evaluated by your NP or doctor.

#### Constipation
Constipation is the passage of dry, hard stool that occurs when materials move too slowly through the large intestine. The normal length of time between bowel movements varies for each person. If you are having fewer bowel movements than what is normal for you, or if you haven't had a bowel movement for more than 2 days, you are probably constipated. 

There are many causes of constipation, including not drinking enough fluids or eating enough fiber, a decrease in your activity, not moving around or walking enough, and side effects of certain medications and chemotherapy drugs. Medications are available to treat constipation. Talk to your NP or doctor if you haven't had a bowel movement for 2 days.

#### Mouth sores
Some chemotherapy drugs affect the cells that line the mouth and digestive tract. This is known as mucositis. Mucositis can cause redness, swelling, tenderness, and sores on the lining of your mouth, tongue, and lips. You may experience some mouth and throat discomfort that can make it difficult to eat or swallow.

#### Skin changes
Skin changes are common after transplant due to the effects of cancer treatment. Skin changes include increased dryness, flaking, discoloration, and darkening. Your skin will be very sensitive to the sun and may sunburn very easily. Avoid bright sunlight and when outdoors, wear sun block (SPF 30) and protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and a hat.

#### Hair loss
The chemotherapy that cancer kills cells also kills the cells that produce your hair. Most patients will lose their hair during their transplant. 

Losing your hair can be an unpleasant and upsetting experience. Like many patients, you can choose to cut your hair short before your transplant to take control of this process and to lessen the shock of losing your hair. Talk this through with your caregiver, friends, and family.

Before your transplant, it is also a good time to think about whether you would like to wear a wig. Modern wigs can look very natural and wearing one might make you feel more comfortable. There are many wig stores in New York, a list of them is provided at the back of this guide. You can get one while you still have your hair, or bring a clipping of your hair, if you'd like your wig to match your natural hair. 

#### Changes to sexual activity
Sexual intimacy provides pleasure and comfort for many people after their treatment. The information below can serve as a guide to being sexually active in a safe way after your transplant. You may have questions or concerns regarding your sexual activity. You are encouraged to discuss your concerns openly with your physician, NP, or nurse.

##### Birth control
While it's likely that you will not be able to conceive a child naturally after high-dose chemotherapy, you and your partner should use contraception (birth control) during and after your chemotherapy. If a woman becomes pregnant with sperm or eggs damaged by exposure to radiation, chemotherapy, or other anticancer medications, there is a risk of miscarriage or birth defects.

It's important to pick a method of birth control that fits your lifestyle and will be effective. When used correctly, condoms are very effective in preventing pregnancy. Women can speak with their gynecologists to choose between the many available options.

##### Protecting your partner from exposure to chemotherapy and other anticancer medications
There is little information about how much anticancer medication gets into a person's body fluids, and even less on whether this poses any risk to a sexual partner. If this is a concern for you, consider using a barrier device whenever your partner may have contact with your semen (if you are male) or vaginal fluids (if you are female). Barrier devices include condoms and dental dams. We don't know how long these medications may be in your body fluids, but you should use barrier devices each day you have chemotherapy and for 1 week afterward.

##### Protecting yourself from infection or bleeding during sex
You will be at increased risk of infection during your transplant period and for many months after your treatment.

Until your doctor tells you that your blood counts and immune system have recovered, follow these precautions:

* Avoid sex that involves penetration or contact with mucous membranes while your blood counts are low (your platelet count needs to be more than 50,000). This includes vaginal, oral, and anal sex or inserting fingers, vibrators, or other sex toys into your vagina or anus.
* Use latex condoms each time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex.
* Use a barrier device (condoms or dental dams) any time your partner's saliva, vaginal secretions, or semen could enter your mouth.
* Abstain from any sexual activity that could expose your mouth to feces.
* Avoid sex that involves contact with mucous membranes if a genital infection is suspected or present in either you or your partner.

Hugging, cuddling, gentle touching, and kissing skin are other ways you can be intimate with your partner during this time. 
For additional information about being sexually active during and after treatment, see the additional resources at the back of this guide:

* *Sexual Activity During Cancer Treatment: Information for Women*
* *Sexual Activity During Cancer Treatment: Information for Men*
* *Sexual Health and Intimacy*

The American Cancer Society publishes 2 well written books on sexuality following cancer treatment. They are available free of charge from your local American Cancer Society:

* *Sexuality for the Man with Cancer and His Partner*
http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/002910-pdf.pdf
* *Sexuality for the Woman with Cancer and Her Partner*
http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/002912-pdf.pdf

#### The Importance of Communication
Throughout your treatment, it's very important that you communicate clearly with your healthcare team and your caregiver about your side effects. 

Tell your healthcare team how you're feeling. Describe how your body feels. Describe how you're doing emotionally. Tell them if anything is worrying you. If you notice changes in how you feel, describe what has changed. If anything bothers you, even if it seems minor, tell your healthcare team. The more information you can communicate to your healthcare team the more they'll be able to help you. There is usually something that they can do to make you feel more comfortable. 

### Living With Neutropenia
As you know, your chemotherapy will kill not only the cancerous cells in your body, but also healthy stem cells that make the different types of cells in your blood. This is why you received a transplant. 

Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, play a crucial role in your immune system. In the days and weeks after your transplant, while your transplanted stem cells are still engrafting, you will have a very low number of neutrophils in your bloodstream. This will leave you at high risk for infection.

You and your caregiver will need to take careful precautions to avoid infections while you are neutropenic. These precautions will include eating a special, low-microbial diet (a diet that contains a low number of potentially harmful microorganisms), washing carefully, taking care of your mouth, and other precautions. 

#### Avoiding Sources of Infection
One of the best ways to avoid infection is to avoid sources of infection. This is easier said than done&mdash;you and your caregiver will need to be careful about seeing visitors, what you touch, and where you go. While you are neutropenic you should try to **avoid**:

* Shaking hands with people. When you do shake hands with people, use hand sanitizer, such as Purell<sup>&reg;</sup> afterward
* Contact with animals, including your pets&mdash;they cannot stay with you during your transplant
* Contact with soil or dirt. You should not keep any plants in your hotel or apartment and should not accept gifts of flowers or plants

Your caregiver will need to carefully manage who comes to see you while you are neutropenic. Your caregiver needs to make sure that friends, family, and other visitors understand these precautions:

* Children under the age of 12 are not allowed to visit or stay with you during your transplant period.
* No visitors are allowed to visit you, either in the clinic or in your hotel or apartment who have any signs of a cold, flu, or who have been exposed to any contagious illness. 
* Your caregiver and any visitors must wash their hands for 15 to 20 seconds before each visitor enters your room at the clinic or at your hotel or apartment. 
* Hand washing or use of a hand sanitizer (Purell<sup>&reg;</sup>) must be repeated each time the visitor enters your room. 
* Visitors and caregivers must use the visitor's restroom in the hallway and not the restroom in your room at the clinic. This is to minimize the spread of bacteria in the room.
* No fresh cut flowers or live plants are allowed in your hotel or apartment or in your room.

Telling people who love you and want to make sure that you're okay that you can't see them can be difficult, but you and your caregiver need to be vigilant. You can explain to them that it's just for a short period of time, and that by taking these precautions, you are making sure that you can see them as soon as possible. They will understand.

We strongly recommend that you use a computer or tablet and programs like Skype, Google Talk/Hangouts, or FaceTime to keep in touch with friends and family when you are neutropenic. 

#### Eating a Low-Microbial Diet
While your counts are returning to normal, and until told otherwise by your healthcare team, you will need to eat what is called a low-microbial diet. 

A low-microbial diet contains fewer microbes (also called microorganisms) than would ordinarily be found in everyday foods. This diet helps people with weakened immune systems and low blood counts reduce the risk of food-borne illnesses caused by bacteria and other microbes (tiny living organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, yeast, and molds) found in some foods and drinks. Eating a diet that contains fewer microbes will help prevent you from getting sick. 

Microbes can attach to foods and grow, but you can't always see, smell, or taste them. They are more likely to grow on milk, unrefrigerated food, undercooked foods, certain fruits and vegetables, unpasteurized juices, and vegetable sprouts&mdash;but in reality, they can grow on any food. 

You will need to take careful precautions with the food you eat, including:

* Buying foods that you know have been stored properly and are safe to eat
* Storing food safely in your hotel or apartment
* Keeping your kitchen very clean
* Keeping your refrigerator very clean
* Handling food safely
* Eating only food that you know has been prepared and cooked in keeping with a low-microbial diet
* Cooking foods thoroughly

Refer to the guide on *Low-Microbial Diet and Safe Food Handling* at the back of this guide and follow the guidelines very carefully when you or your caregiver are buying, handling, preparing and cooking food.  

#### Coping with separation from children
Children under 12 are not able to visit you during your transplant period because of the risk of infection. This separation will be difficult for you, your child, and the rest of your family. We know from past experience that patients with children experience a range of feelings and reactions related to this separation. 

We strongly recommend that you take time to talk to one of our social workers about being separated from your children. You or your caregiver should tell your NP, nurse coordinator, or any member of the healthcare team that you'd like to speak with one of the social workers and they will make sure to come and see you. They will listen to your concerns and help you develop a plan to for maintain strong ties to your children while you are undergoing treatment.

Here are some things that other patients have done to remain in contact with their children during their transplant.

* Use a computer or tablet and programs like Skype, Google Talk/Hangouts, or FaceTime to talk to your children regularly. Set up a time that you talk to them each day, such as when they get home from school and before they go to bed. Get into a routine of using the computer to see them and talk to them.
* Paint or create other crafts to send home. Craft supplies can be provided to you by the Patient Recreation Center. Ask a member of your healthcare team to arrange for the Patient Recreation Center to bring supplies to you.
* Use your phone to make an audio recording of yourself as you read your children's favorite stories. Upload these recordings to the web, give them to your caregiver, or email them to your children. They can read along with these stories while listening to your voice.
* Keep copies of your children's favorite stories with you in your apartment or hotel. At night, you can use Skype to read along with them before they go to sleep. 
* Ask your children to decorate your apartment or hotel with pictures; your caregiver can bring them to you and you can show them hanging on the wall over Skype.
* Give your child a special coloring book or journal for times when they miss you, or when feelings are difficult. Your caregiver can bring the colorings to you. You can talk to your child about them over Skype or the phone.

We understand that nothing will replace physical contact between you and your children, but we strongly encourage you to use all available technology to maintain a strong bond with them while you are unable to see them.

For more assistance related to maintaining your relationship with your children, contact your social worker. 

#### Showering and bathing
While you are neutropenic, keeping yourself clean is very important. 

You should shower or bathe daily. When you shower or bathe, you should use soap that can kill germs. Look for the words "antibacterial" or "antimicrobial." Dial<sup>&reg;</sup> is one example, but there are many others. 

When you shower or bathe, take extra care to make sure you wash yourself thoroughly. Begin with your upper body, then the middle section, and wash the lower area including your feet last. Wash carefully under your arms, in your anal and genital areas, and in any skin folds. Germs tend to live in these moist areas. You may shampoo your scalp with soap once a day. 

After you urinate or move your bowels, wash your buttocks and genital area with antibacterial soap. You can also use moist wipes. Pat the area dry. Wash your hands well afterward.

When you wash or bathe, take care of your catheter; detailed instructions on how to protect your catheter against water are included at the back of this guide. 

#### Mouth Care
While you're neutropenic and have a low platelet count, you will need to change the way you brush your teeth and care for your mouth. This will help to avoid infection and bleeding.

Follow these guidelines to take good care of your mouth:

* You will be given a mouthwash to rinse your mouth before and after meals and at bedtime. The number of rinses may be increased to every 2 hours, depending on how your mouth feels.
* Use only the mouthwash that your nurse gives you. Do not use mouthwash or toothpaste from any store. These products irritate and dry the mouth and throat.
* Use an ultra-soft toothbrush.
* Do not use dental floss.
* Avoid licking your lips. It increases drying and chapping.
* Apply a lubricant like Chapstick<sup>&reg;</sup> after you clean or rinse your mouth and every 2 to 4 hours as needed. This will help keep your lips moist.
* To avoid an infection in your mouth, your doctor will prescribe an oral antifungal antibiotic. Use it as instructed.
* If your mouth becomes sensitive, avoid hot, spicy, acidic, or coarse foods. You may prefer soft or liquid food served chilled or at room temperature.
* If you have a pain in your mouth, your doctor will prescribe medication for the pain.

### Living With a Low Platelet Count
Platelets clump together to help stop bleeding. Because you will have a very low platelet count after your chemotherapy, you will need to take special care to avoid cuts and strenuous activities that might cause bleeding. You will need to take special care of your gums and mouth because it's common for bleeding to start there. You and your caregiver will take these special precautions:

* Avoid sharp objects, such as razors, scissors, and nail clippers. You should only shave using an electric razor/shaver and not a razor that has a blade.
* Do not have manicures, pedicures, waxes, electrolysis, or tattoos.
* Do not have any dental work done.
* Follow the guidelines on mouth care (above).
* Do not use rectal suppositories, enemas, or tampons.
* Do not take your temperature rectally.
* Consider using stool softeners or laxatives if you are straining to have bowel movements.
* Avoid tight clothing or any clothing that you have to strain to put on or take off.

You should avoid any activity that may result in injury. This includes:

* Contact sports
* Climbing ladders
* Strenuous exercise
* Bicycling
* Weight lifting

You should take precautions when you are having sex. You should use lubrication if needed and avoid anal or oral sex. Avoid strong thrusting, as this can cause bleeding. 

You should avoid medications that have not been explicitly prescribed to you by your medical team. Do not take:

* Aspirin or products that contain aspirin
* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Advil<sup>&reg;</sup>
* Vitamin E

All of these medications make it more difficult for your blood to clot and are very dangerous for somebody like you with a limited ability to heal and clot.

Call your doctor if you develop any symptoms of bleeding. Be on the lookout for:

* Bruising
* A faint red rash on your torso, arms, or legs
* Vaginal spotting or heavy menstrual bleeding
* The appearance of broken blood vessels in the whites of your eyes

If you notice that you are bleeding you should take these steps immediately:

1. Apply direct pressure on the bleeding site.
2. After applying pressure, follow the BMT Emergency Guide. If it is between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm, call the BMT Outpatient Clinic at (212) 639-2399. If it is after 8:00 pm, call (212) 639-2000 and ask for the doctor covering bone marrow transplant.
3. Apply ice over the bridge of your nose for nosebleeds.

Call your doctor immediately if you:

* Have black bowel movements, blood in your stool, or rectal bleeding
* Have blood in your urine
* Have a headache that does not get better, blurred vision, or dizziness
* Cough up blood, vomit blood, or get a nose bleed

### Living With a Low Red Blood Cell Count (Anemia)
Your chemotherapy will cause you to have a very low red blood cell count, a condition known as anemia. Hemoglobin in red blood cells carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues in all parts of the body. When your red blood cell count is low, your body cannot carry oxygen as well. Anemia can make you feel tired and weak. You may also feel dizzy or lightheaded when changing positions quickly from lying to standing. 

Some of the side effects of anemia include:

* Increased tiredness
* Weakness
* Rapid heartbeat
* Shortness of breath
* Headache
* Pale skin

If you have anemia, your doctor may prescribe 1 or more of the following:

* A transfusion
* Rest
* Changes to your diet
* Iron supplements

### Receiving a Transfusion
Your doctor may recommend a blood transfusion to boost the number of platelets or red blood cells in your body. 

If your doctor recommends a transfusion, it will be given to you through your catheter during one of your regular visits to the Outpatient BMT Clinic. 

A transfusion of red blood cells usually takes 2 to 4 hours. Transfusions of other blood components, like platelets, takes only 15 to 30 minutes.

#### Sourcing blood for your transfusion
The blood used in your transfusion is donated at our blood bank. There is no substitute for real blood, so we are incredibly grateful to the people who donate blood. 

Your friends and relatives may donate red blood cells and platelets&mdash;this is known as a directed donation. Your friends and relatives are eligible to donate if they:

* Are between 16 and 75 years old. No parental consent is required for those who are at least 17 years old
* Weigh at least 110 pounds
* Are in good health
* Have not had an illness such as hepatitis, jaundice, cancer, etc.
* Do not have signs of a cold or active allergy at the time of donation
* Have not taken aspirin, or any medication that has aspirin or aspirin-like drugs (ibuprofen, Motrin<sup>&reg;</sup>, Naprosyn<sup>&reg;</sup>, Anaprox<sup>&reg;</sup>, Advil<sup>&reg;</sup>, Aleve<sup>&reg;</sup>) within 3 days before giving blood
* Have identification showing their name and photograph or signature
* Have not consumed alcohol for at least 8 hours before donating

Blood donations can be given by appointment at our Blood Donor Room, which is located at:

Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
Schwartz Building Lobby
1250 First Avenue
(Between East 67<sup>th</sup> and East 68<sup>th</sup> Streets)
New York, NY 10065

For more information about making a directed donation and to make an appointment, your friends and family should call our Blood Donor Room at (212) 639-7643.

If your friend or family member has a blood type that isn't compatible with yours, then their blood will be released for use with other patients at MSKCC.

Directed donations will be held for you for 30 days. After that, the blood will be released for use with other patients at MSKCC.

#### Making sure blood is safe
After it is donated, all blood is tested for:

* Syphilis
* Hepatitis B and C
* Exposure to the HIV virus
* The presence of a virus associated with a very rare form of leukemia
* West Nile virus
* *Trypanosoma cruzi* (a type of microorganism)

The chance of getting any of these from donated blood is very small. Directed donations are tested in exactly the same way as other donations.  

#### Risks associated with blood transfusions
Blood transfusions have some risks. These risks include the very slight chance of having an allergic reaction or acquiring an infection through tainted blood.

#### Side effects during and after your transfusion
Transfusions sometimes cause reactions. The most common symptoms are fever, chills, and hives. These can be treated with a variety of medications. Transfusion reactions are rarely life threatening. The nursing staff constantly checks all patients while a blood transfusion is taking place.

Allergic reactions can sometimes occur. Symptoms are listed below. They can occur up to 48 hours after the transfusion. Call your doctor immediately if you have:

* A temperature of 100.4&deg;F(38&deg;C) or higher, or chills
* Flushing of the face
* Hives, rash, or itching
* Trouble breathing or shortness of breath
* Lower back pain
* Nausea or vomiting
* Weakness or fainting
* Blood in your urine
* Chest pain (If you have chest pain, call your local emergency number immediately)

### Exercise
Exercise is an important part of the recovery process during and after stem cell transplantation. Benefits of exercise include preventing loss of endurance, muscle strength, and bone density. Exercise can also prevent respiratory and circulatory problems and improve your ability to be as independent as possible.

While in the outpatient transplant program, you are encouraged to walk to and from the hospital daily, which will help to maintain your conditioning. During the hours you are in clinic, you are encouraged to walk in the hallways (wearing a mask and gloves) 2 to 3 times daily. While you are staying locally, you are encouraged to walk outside (weather permitting). 

If you have special needs, you will be seen by a physical therapist for an evaluation.

## Life After Your Transplant
You will remain in the nearby apartment or hotel for several weeks following your stem cell transplant, returning to the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day. 

When your healthcare team sees that you are ready, they will allow you to return home. You and your caregiver will check out of your apartment or hotel. You will still visit the clinic&mdash;but less frequently.

Before you return home, it's important that you and your caregiver prepare. We have prepared a guide called *Returning Home after your Autologous Transplant*. It is included at the end of this guide.
