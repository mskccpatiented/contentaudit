## Welcome, Overview
Welcome to the Outpatient Autologous Stem Cell Transplant program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. 

### What's in This Guide
This guide will help you learn about autologous stem cell transplantation; what it is, why it's been recommended for you and what happens in each phase of the transplant. The information in the guide will compliment the verbal information you receive from your healthcare team.

### How To Use This Guide
You should read this guide completely at least once including any additional materials included at the back of the guide - then refer to the guide as your treatment progresses.

As you read through the guide make a note of any questions that come to mind. A member of your healthcare team will answer your questions when you see them next.

### Language Used In This Guide
We've done our best to keep the number of medical terms in this guide to a minimum, however there are some words that we need you to understand so that you can participate fully in your treatment. With this in mind, we've prepared a glossary of useful terms and included it at the back of this guide. 

### We Need Your Help
We are always improving the information we provide to patients and their families/friends. If you get to the end of this guide and can think of ways it could be improved (maybe there's something that was missing, or wasn't completely clear), please e-mail us at patiented@mskcc.org and we'll incorporate your feedback into the next version.

## Bone Marrow Basics

### What is Bone Marrow, What Are Stem Cells?
<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder:Diagram of the process by which stem cells become blood; marrow->stem cells->differentiated cells. The stock ones available online are not good and we can do better.</p></div>

Bone marrow is a substance found in the spaces in the center of the larger bones in your body; your hip, breastbone and pelvis.

Your bone marrow contains a large number of stem cells. Stem cells are immature cells that produce all of the blood cells in your body; the white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that carry oxygen and and platelets that clot to stop you from bleeding. Your stem cells are constantly dividing and changing into the different types of blood cells in your body - replacing older blood cells. As well as being found in your bone marrow, some stem cells also circulate in your bloodstream.

You will hear your transplant referred to as a "bone marrow transplant" or a "stem cell transplant". Technically, stem cell transplant is more correct - as you'll receive an infusion of stem cells. 

### Autologous Stem Cell Transplant
An autologous stem cell transplant is being recommended for you because, while you have cancer, you are in relatively good health and your doctors feel that a transplant is the best treatment for your specific disease.

Autologous means "from yourself". When you have an autologous stem cell transplant your stem cells are harvested from your body and then frozen before you receive chemotherapy. You will receive a very high-dose of chemotherapy to kill the cancer in your body. This very high dose of chemotherapy will also destroy most of the blood cells in your bone marrow and bloodstream. 

Collecting your stem cells beforehand allows us to then return your stem cells to you. Once your stem cells have been given back to you they will slowly start to make new immune and blood cells. You are literally receiving a stem cell transplant "from yourself".

An autologous transplant has three key phases:

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of the process of harvesting/collection. Apheresis. </p></div>
**Before** - You will prepare for your stem cell transplant. You will receive drugs that stimulate your body to make more stem cells than normal and encourage those stem cells to circulate in your bloodstream. Your stem cells will be harvested from your bloodstream and then stored. A central venous catheter will be inserted into your upper chest wall. 

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of chemotherapy being given through the catheter. </p></div>

**During** - You will receive your chemotherapy, called the "conditioning regimen", to kill the cancer cells. Your stem cells and other blood cells will also be killed and you will lose your ability to make new blood cells. Your immune system will be severely compromised. Your stem cells will be taken from storage and infused into your body through your catheter. This is your stem cell transplant.

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of the process of engraftment. </p></div>

**After** - The infused stem cells find their way through your bloodstream to your bones. Over time they take hold in your bones, a process called "engraftment". They begin to divide and create healthy, new blood cells. Your immune and vital systems begin to return to normal.

### Outpatient Autologous Stem Cell Transplant
Until relatively recently stem cell transplant patients would live in the hospital while undergoing treatment and would remain in the hospital for a period of their recovery (an inpatient transplant). 

Now it's possible for some patients to receive some of their care in the hospital at an outpatient clinic while living in a local hotel or apartment (an outpatient transplant). 

Your doctor has decided that you can undergo an outpatient transplant. You will receive your treatment (pre-transplant testing, high-dose chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, follow-up care) in our outpatient clinic each day before returning to a local hotel or apartment each night. You will only be admitted to the hospital if you develop complications. 

Here is a typical timeline for someone having an outpatient transplant:

* *Day −4:* You and your caregiver will check into a hotel or apartment close to MSKCC's main campus in Manhattan. 
* *Day −3:* You and your caregiver will come to MSKCC's Interventional Radiology department at main campus where a central venous catheter will be inserted in your upper chest wall. You will return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.
* *Day −2:* You will come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic where you receive your chemotherapy. You will return to your hotel or apartment in the evening. (Note that, in some cases, patients can require multiple days of chemotherapy. Your healthcare team will explain your specific treatment plan to you) 
* *Day −1:* This is a rest day; you will remain in your hotel or apartment for the day.
* *Day 0:* Transplant day. You will come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic where you receive your stem cell transplant. You will return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.
* *Day +1 to +12:* You will visit the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day to have blood work done, your vital signs checked and a physical examination. You'll also receive hydration, electrolytes and transfusions if necessary. While you are in the outpatient clinic you will be cared for in a private room that has a bed and bathroom. A light breakfast and lunch will be provided for you. There is a communal lounge with coffee and tea for caregivers. You return to your hotel or apartment each evening. 

After *Day +12* your central venous catheter will be removed. If you live within one hour of MSKCC's main campus you can return home. If you live further away you will stay at your local hotel or apartment for a few more weeks. You will still visit the Outpatient BMT Clinic regularly. 

You'll see that the days leading up to your transplant are given minus number; Day −3, Day −2 etc. The day of your transplant is Day 0, and the days that follow are Day +1, Day +2 etc. Your healthcare team will use this format when they explain your transplant to you. 

## Your Transplant Team
<div class="image-placeholder invisible"><p>Image Placeholder: Photograph of the outpatient transplant team would work, if printing is not an issue.</p></div>

A team of healthcare professionals from the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service will care for you through all phases of your treatment. Below you'll find a list of the team members and their roles. You will meet each member of your healthcare team at different times during your treatment.

Your **attending doctor** will be in charge of your care throughout your treatment. Even though one specific doctor will be your primary doctor, you will be cared for by different doctors during your transplant.

A **fellow** is a doctor who has completed general training and is receiving additional training in cancer care. 

A **nurse practitioner (NP)** is a nurse who has a master's or doctoral degree. The nurse practitioner is licensed to examine you, provide medical treatments and prescribe medications. The NPs will be responsible for your daily care when you come to the Outpatient Clinic.

Your **BMT Nurse Coordinator** is a nurse who will communicate and work with you, your caregiver and your team of doctors to organize all the testing, procedures and consults with other professionals required prior to your transplant. The Nurse Coordinator will provide you with treatment calendars describing the timeline for your plan of care and education about the pre-transplant process.

A team of **nurses** will provide your day-to-day nursing care. They are registered nurses specially trained in the care of stem cell transplant patients.

The **hospitalist** is a doctor who only sees patients while they are in the hospital. At MSKCC a hospitalist is on duty all night. 

A **Clinical Pharmacist** who specializes in the care of transplant patients will review your medications with you and your caregiver, teaching you how to take them properly and to inform you of any side effects they may cause. The pharmacist will review and monitor your medications frequently with the outpatient team.

**Social Workers** are members of the healthcare team who will help you, your family and those around you manage the stress that comes with the transplant process. The social workers understand the issues faced by transplant patients and are on hand to listen, offer counseling, and refer you or your family to other resources and services as needed. 

**House staff** are doctors who are completing their residency. They work under the supervision of the fellows and attending doctors.

**Financial Counselors** from Patient Financial Services will work with you and your insurance company to determine your transplant benefits. These financial counselors are experienced in the insurance issues faced by transplant patients. Each insurance company and their policies differ, so when your insurance company requires authorization your financial counselor will assist with that process. 

**Session Assistants**
<p class="outstanding">To be written.</p>

While you are here, you will come to know all of the members of your team.

## Phase 1 - Before Your Transplant
<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Diagram of the transplant process/timeline with a "you are here" marker on Phase one, or highlighting of some kind.</p></div>

Phase 1 of your treatment begins when you meet your Outpatient BMT team on or around Day −30 and runs all the way up to the start of your chemotherapy.

### Phase 1 - Summary and Checklist
In this phase you'll make preparations for your transplant; practically, physically and emotionally. This will be a very busy time for you and your family. 

Here is a list of things that will happen, and things that you need to do, in Phase 1. You can check off items as you go along:

* Learn about your Transplant - Read this guide in full at least once, along with the accompanying information at the back. 
* Make a list of Questions - Make a note of anything that you don't understand about your transplant, anything in the guide that isn't clear, and any other questions you have.
* Meet your Team - Meet your doctor and members of your healthcare team. Take this time to ask about your treatment and ask them to answer your questions.
* Choose a Caregiver - Identify a family member or friend to act as your caregiver. Make sure they understand what the role entails and give them a copy of this guide. Ask them to read the guide in full at least once.
* Get Financial Clearance - Meet your Financial Counselor and speak to your insurance company. Make sure your outpatient stem cell transplant and medications are covered.
* Make Decisions about your Fertility - Speak with your healthcare team about your fertility options and take measures to preserve your fertility.
* Arrange Childcare - Your children cannot stay with you at the hotel or apartment during your outpatient transplant. You should make arrangements for them to be cared for while you are receiving your treatment.
* Arrange Pet Care - Your pets cannot stay with you during your transplant so make arrangements for them.
* Attend Orientation - Attend the online orientation for Outpatient Autologous Stem Cell Transplant patients. Ask your BMT Nurse Coordinator for details.
* Pre-Transplant Evaluation - You'll undergo a series of medical tests. Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will talk you through the schedule for these tests.
* Arrange Housing - The BMT Nurse Coordinator will make arrangements for you to stay at a local hotel or apartment and will give you details.
* Arrange transportation - <span class="outstanding notblock">Check</span>
* Understand Nutrition - Meet with a dietitian to review special dietary requirements and safe food handling
* Learn about the Temperature and Fluid Log - You and your caregiver will be learn how to take your temperature, record how much you drink and how to write this information down in a diary
* Social Work Consultation - Meet with a social worker who will explain the psychological, emotional and financial support services offered by the social work team 
* Mobilization - You will give yourself injections of a medication to increase the number of stem cells in your bloodstream
* Harvesting - You will visit our blood donor and your stem cells will be harvested from your bloodstream
* Have your Catheter Inserted - You will visit our interventional radiology department and a central venous catheter will be inserted into your chest wall
* Learn Catheter Care - A nurse will show you and your caregiver how to look after your catheter, change dressings etc.

<p class="outstanding">This will be a checkable list - circles where the patient and the caregiver can check-off items. We need to validate this list and add anything else we think is relevant.</p>

### Meeting Your Team
On or around Day −30 you'll meet with your attending physician and other members of your healthcare team. Your attending physician will explain the type of treatment you'll undergo and will talk through the likely treatment plan. The treatment plan is the specific plan for your treatment that takes into account your disease, overall health and other factors. The treatment plan will be refined as you undergo pre-transplant tests.

<p class="question">I don't have a great understanding of this. I know that there is an initial meet and greet and then a more detailed follow up - but that sometimes they are the same meeting. A little insight would be greatly appreciated.</p>

### Choosing Your Caregiver
One of the most important steps as you prepare for your transplant is choosing your caregiver. This person is usually a family member or a close friend and will be an important part of your healthcare team. Your caregiver will be responsible for a lot of the day to day medical, practical, emotional support you need during your outpatient transplant. 

Your caregiver will receive specific instructions from the healthcare team about their responsibilities. Some of these responsibilities include: 

#### Medical Support 
* Gathering information from the healthcare team
* Caring for your catheter 
* Making sure you take your medications and keeping a written record of when you take your medications
* Taking your temperature every 4 hours while you are awake and keeping a written record of your temperature
* Keeping a written record of how much fluid you drink every day
* Noticing any changes in your condition
* Telling your healthcare team about any new symptoms you may have or changes in your condition
* Calling for medical help in an emergency

#### Practical Support
* Dealing with financial and insurance issues 
* Preparing your meals according to a low-microbial diet
* Bring you to and from the hospital
* Maintaining a clean environment in your hotel, apartment or house
* Keeping family members and friends up to date about your condition
* Managing the number of visitors you have and keeping you away from anyone who is sick

#### Emotional Support
* Paying attention to your moods and feelings
* Communicating with you, listening to you
* Understanding your needs and your decisions

#### Choosing the Right Caregiver
Being a caregiver is a full-time, 24/7 responsibility and can be tiring, demanding and stressful - especially if your condition, schedule or treatment changes. 

While you're undergoing your transplant your caregiver will not be able to work and will need to stay with you for most of the day and night (though while you are in the Outpatient BMT clinic your caregiver can take some time for themselves; this is something we strongly recommend).

It is important for your caregiver to maintain a positive attitude, calm demeanor and flexible approach - and to provide you with encouragement. It's important for you to understand that the caregiver role is challenging and that your caregiver might find themselves stressed by the responsibilities.

Take time now to think about who you would like to be your caregiver. It should be somebody you trust who can take the time to care for you. Your caregiver should be someone who can offer you the practical and emotional support you need. 

#### Multiple Caregivers
If there isn't one person who can act as your caregiver then it may be possible for you to have different caregivers scheduled during different times. It is best to limit the number of caregivers to 1 or 2 individuals. 

#### Resources for Caregivers
Talk to your healthcare team about choosing a caregiver. We have included useful resources for caregivers at the back of this guide.

### Financial Clearance
Stem cell transplants are complex and costly. You will need to check that your pre-transplant tests, high-dose chemotherapy, stem cell infusion, post-transplant care, housing, medications and other expenses are covered by your insurance coverage. If they are then you will be "financially cleared" to begin treatment. 

Early in your journey with us you will meet with a representative from MSKCC's Patient Financial Services department - your Financial Counselor. Your financial counselor will gather information about your treatment plan and your health insurance coverage. The financial counselor will liaise with your insurance company and will check what aspects of your care are and are not covered. They will be available to answer questions about your medical expenses and bills throughout your treatment.

### Pre-Transplant Medical Evaluation 
Before you become a transplant candidate your overall physical condition needs to be evaluated. You will need to make several trips to MSKCC where you will undergo tests. We often refer to this as the "work-up" or "restaging" period. During the work-up you will need to have some or all of the following tests done:

* A chest x-ray - done to ensure your lungs are clear and there is no evidence of a pneumonia or other problems
* Blood tests - done to evaluate your baseline kidney and liver function, and to assess your white blood cell, hemoglobin and platelet counts. Your past exposure to certain viruses is also checked
* Urine tests
* Electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (ECHO) or other tests that give information about your heart
* Pulmonary function tests (PFT's) - breathing tests that measure lung function
* Computerized axial tomography (CT) Scan - an x-ray that provides cross-sectional views and images of soft tissue as well as bone. Some scans use contrast dye that you drink or have injected into your body. Please alert your doctor if you have a known allergy to contrast dye, or seafood or iodine. If you have an allergy you may need to be given steroids to prevent a reaction the dye before your scan.
* Dental Exam - You must have a full dental exam. Any cavities, loose fillings or gum disease should be taken care of before your transplant. You can have these done by your own dentist or you can see our dentist. If you see your own dentist please ask them to provide a note saying that you have no dental problems. If there are issues please ask the dentist to contact MSKCC dentist.
* Positron emission tomography (PET) Scan – a scan used to visualize physiologic function in body areas.
* Bone marrow Aspiration and Biopsy - A bone marrow aspirate is a small sample of bone marrow usually taken from the back of your hip. Your hip will be numbed and a needle will be inserted into the bone marrow and a small amount of bone marrow liquid will be withdrawn. A bone marrow biopsy will be performed at the same time as your bone marrow aspiration. The biopsy involves collecting a tiny piece of bone for examination. This procedure is done to evaluate how well your bone marrow is producing cells and to check for any sign of cancer in the marrow.
* Skeletal survey - An x-ray of the major bones in your body done to check for any signs of disease. This can take a few hours to complete.

These tests are usually done in the 30 days before your transplant (Day −30 onwards), but sometimes the pre-transplant evaluation can take longer. The BMT Nurse Coordinator will work with you and your caregiver to schedule the tests.

The results of the tests will be used to plan your treatment and adjust it to your specific needs and to make sure that it is safe to start your treatment.

Your doctor and nurse will explain any other tests that you may need.

### Making Decisions about your Fertility
Your cancer treatment will effect your fertility. It is likely that you will not be able to conceive a child naturally after undergoing your conditioning regimen - the high-dose chemotherapy that precedes your stem cell infusion. 

In come cases it's possible to take  steps to preserve your fertility before you undergo treatment - women can bank eggs or embryos and men can bank sperm. These steps may allow you to conceive in the future. If you have received chemotherapy in the past there is a risk that your sperm or eggs have already been damaged and so preserving your fertility may not be an option. 

We have summarized the most common steps that people take to preserve their fertility before undergoing a stem cell transplant. If you want to learn more about fertility preservation options and other ways you might build a family after your transplant then you should ask your doctor or nurse for a referral to a fertility expert.

##### Options For Men
Men can freeze sperm before treatment. The first step is to schedule an appointment at a sperm bank, where you will masturbate and collect your ejaculated fluid in a sterile cup. 

The sperm bank will analyze the specimen to be sure there are healthy sperm to freeze. The semen is then placed in vials and frozen. It can be stored for as long as you want, even for many years. We recommend that men collect three separate specimens if possible, abstaining from sex for two to five days before the first collection and between the other collections.

For more information please read the guides *Sperm Banking* and *Cancer and Fertility: Information for Men* included at the back of this guide. These guides are also available online:

* [Sperm Banking](http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/899.pdf)
* [Cancer and Fertility: Information for Men](http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/713.pdf)

##### Options For Women
Women can freeze eggs or embryos before treatment. The first step is to schedule an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist (a doctor with special training in fertility). Ask your doctor or a member of your healthcare team to refer you to the reproductive endocrinologist. 

The reproductive endocrinologist will evaluate your fertility and will give you advice on how best to proceed. 

If these tests show you can be successful in collecting eggs, on or around the first day of your period you will start giving yourself daily hormone injections. This medicine will stimulate some of the eggs in your ovaries to mature. You will need the injections for about 10 days, during which you will be closely monitored by the reproductive endocrinologist. Once the eggs are fully mature, you will be scheduled for the egg retrieval. This is an outpatient procedure done using anesthesia so you will be asleep. The eggs are collected using a very thin needle passed through the wall of your vagina.

If you are going to store embryos, your eggs are fertilized with sperm in the laboratory (in vitro fertilization, IVF) before freezing. If you are going to store eggs, they are not fertilized with sperm before freezing. The frozen eggs or embryos can be stored for as long as you want, even for many years.

Another possible option to preserve fertility is ovarian tissue freezing. This is experimental.

For more information please read the guides * Cancer and Fertility: Information for Women* and *Selecting a Reproductive Endocrinologist* included at the back of this guide. These guides are also available online:

* [Cancer and Fertility: Information for Women](http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/725.pdf)
* [Selecting a Reproductive Endocrinologist](http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/739.pdf)

##### Financial Issues Related to Fertility Preservation
Unfortunately, fertility preservation is not covered by most insurance plans. Sperm banking can cost up to about $1000, and egg or embryo freezing can cost $10,000 to $15,000. There are also annual storage fees. 

The financial staff at the sperm bank and reproductive endocrinologist will contact your insurance company to determine if you have coverage. 

There are financial assistance programs available, including Fertile Hope, a discount programs for eligible patients managed through [LIVESTRONG](http://www.livestrong.org). For more information about this, ask your nurse or a member of your healthcare team for an application.

### Making Arrangements for Childcare
<div class="outstanding">To be written. Social work team should provide input. It might be useful to include information about communicating with children, speaking to them about transplant.</div>

### Making Arrangements for Your Pets
Animals can carry diseases and may present risks to you while your immune system is compromised. During your transplant period (chemotherapy through recovery) you should minimize direct contact with animals. Your pets will not be able to stay with you at the hotel or apartment, so you should arrange for them to be cared for while you are away from home.

You should also take these precautions:

* Be sure that your pet is up-to-date with immunizations and any booster shots. Have your veterinarian check your pet's stool for parasites.
* Have your pet treated for fleas. If your pet walks through wooded areas have it screened for ticks.
* If you do come into contact with your pets do not allow your pets to sleep with you. Don't allow your pets to lick you in the face.
* Protect yourself from bites or scratches.
* Do not clean cat litter boxes or clean up after your dog in the street. Have someone else do these things for you. 
* Avoid all contact with birds, lizards, snakes, turtles, iguanas, exotic pets, hamsters or other rodents while you recover. Contact with birds or reptiles waste may expose you to certain infectious agents.

After you have recovered from your transplant you will be provided additional instructions regarding pet care in the "Returning Home After Your Autologous Transplant" guide included at the back of this guide.

### Moving into a Nearby Apartment or Hotel
For the duration of your treatment you and your caregiver will stay at a hotel or apartment within walking distance of the Outpatient BMT Clinic at MSKCC's main hospital. You and your caregiver will make regular visits to the Outpatient BMT Clinic. 
The arrangements for your lodgings will be made and communicated to you by your BMT nurse coordinator. 

### Mobilization and Harvesting
In an autologous transplant your stem cells are first mobilized and then harvested (also called "collected") from your body before you receive chemotherapy. 

Mobilization is the process of increasing the number of stem cells produced by your bone marrow and released into your bloodstream. 

Stem cell harvesting, or collecting, is the process of separating whole blood into its major components (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma) then removing stem cells from the white blood cell component.

Once your stem cells have been harvested they are frozen and stored, then infused into your body after your chemotherapy; this is your stem cell transplant.

#### Mobilization
Normally your stem cells live in your bone marrow (although a few circulate in your bloodstream) where they are difficult to access and collect for transplantation. 

To increase the amount of stem cells in your bloodstream you'll be given injections of a drug called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF). GCSF stimulates your body to make more stem cells than usual and encourages them to move into your bloodstream where they can be collected much more easily. This process is called *mobilization*. GCSF drugs include filgrastim (Neupogen<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>), pegfilgrastim (Neulasta<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>) and plerixafor (Mozobil<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>). 

In most cases GCSF injections are self-administered, that is you will inject yourself with the drug while at home. You will be given the GCSF in pre-filled syringes, which you'll keep in your refrigerator. Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will create a personal Mobilization Calendar for you which will tell you when to give yourself the injections. The number of injections needed will depend on a number of factors, including your weight.

A full guide to giving yourself GCSF injections is covered in the document "Directions for Giving an Injection Below the Skin with Neupogen (Filgrastim) or Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) in a Pre-Filled Syringe" which is included at the back of this guide. Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will talk you through this information as well. 

Some patients will not give themselves injections of Neupogen or Neulasta (both types of GCSF), and will instead be given a different type of GCSF called Mozobil. If Mozobil is recommended for you then the injections will be given by a nurse in the BMT clinic.

#### Harvesting of your Stem Cells
<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: The harvesting/collection process. Patient connected to apheresis machine.</p></div>

The injections of GCSF into your body will stimulate the growth and mobilization of your stem cells, then they will be harvested. Harvesting is the procedure used to collect some of these stem cells in your blood. 

Before you are scheduled for stem cell harvesting a nurse or doctor will examine your veins to see if they are okay for the procedure. If your veins are not healthy enough arrangements will be made to have your catheter fitted, which will then be used during harvesting. 

The harvesting procedure is done in the Blood Donor Room. Your BMT Nurse Coordinator or your doctor will schedule 3-5 harvesting sessions to collect enough cells. The exact number of sessions is determined by the number of stem cells that are collected in each session. You will be notified each day if you need to return for another harvesting session. Each session will last three to four hours.

You should eat dairy products or other foods that are rich in calcium the night before and the morning of your harvesting session. Wear comfortable clothes. 

You will lie in a bed or sit in a reclining chair. You will be connected to a machine by IV tubes connected to your veins in your arms or your catheter. Blood will be withdrawn through the IV line or catheter and circulated through the machine where your stem cells will be collected. The rest of your blood is returned to you. 

If you wish, you will be able to watch TV or read. A family member or friend may sit with you during the procedure started. Since patients sometimes complain of feeling cold during the procedure, blankets will be available.

After your harvesting procedure is done a dressing will be applied to your arm to prevent bleeding. It should remain in place for at least three hours, but not more than five hours. , If your catheter was used then it will be flushed and recapped. 

Your stem cells will be brought to our stem cell laboratory where they'll be frozen and and stored safely until your transplant day.

After harvesting most patients have minimal side effects and can resume their regular activities. The most common side effects are numbness or tingling in the lips, hands or feet. This is caused by a temporary decrease in the calcium levels in your blood during the harvesting. 

Call Your Doctor If You:

* Develop a fever (100.4° F or 38° C) or chills.
* Notice any redness, bleeding, drainage, or pain at the catheter or needle insertion site.

### Having Your Central Venous Catheter Inserted
On or before Day −4 you and your caregiver will come to MSKCC's Interventional Radiology department at main campus to have a central venous catheter inserted into the wall of your chest. 

#### What is a Central Venous Catheter? Why Do I Need One?
<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: A clear diagram of the central venous catheter.</p></div>
A central venous catheter is a tube inserted into a large vein near your collarbone. On the outside of your body the catheter divides into 2 or 3 smaller tubes called "lumens". 

A central venous catheter allows your healthcare team to give you medicine, fluids, electrolytes, blood transfusions and chemotherapy without the need to stick you repeatedly with a needle. Having a catheter will make your treatment much more comfortable. 

The catheter will stay in your body throughout your treatment and is usually removed around twelve days after you receive your stem cell transplant.

#### Before Your Catheter is Inserted
Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will work with you to schedule the insertion of your catheter. 

In the days leading up to the insertion of your catheter you shouldn't take aspirin, any products that contain aspirin, or vitamin E. You should also tell your doctor if you are taking any blood thinners or any medication for diabetes.

In the days leading up to the insertion of your catheter you should call your doctor if you develop any illness. This includes a fever, cold, flu, or sore throat.

If you have been told to be on a clear liquid diet before your catheter is inserted you shouldn't eat any solid food after midnight the night before the procedure and you should continue to drink clear liquids up to 2 hours before you arrive at the hospital for your procedure. Your healthcare team will let you know if this applies to you.

#### The Day Your Catheter is Inserted
The catheter will be inserted at our Surgical Day Hospital. You will probably already be staying in a nearby hotel or apartment, so you should arrange transportation between your lodging and the surgical day hospital. 

You should report to the Surgical Day Hospital several hours before the procedure is scheduled to take place. This will allow the medical team to evaluate you and make sure everything is in order before they insert the catheter. 

On the morning of the procedure you may shower, but you shouldn't apply any creams or lotions to your body. Take any medications you've been instructed to take. 

If you wear contact lenses you should wear glasses on the day your catheter is inserted. If you don't own glasses then bring a container for your contact lenses to the hospital with you. 

You and your caregiver should leave all valuables, including jewelry, at home. Bring only your medications and the money you need for the day to the hospital. 

Enter the hospital through the main entrance at 1275 York Avenue. Take the M elevators at the top of the escalator to the 2<span class="superscript">nd</span> floor. As you step off the elevator, enter the double doors to the Surgical Day Hospital. Check in at the desk. Please arrive on time.

In the Surgical Day Hospital you will change into a gown, robe, and slippers. When you are ready, you will be taken to Interventional Radiology.

#### The Procedure
<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: A diagram or image showing the incision and placement of the catheter. The text is quite intimidating, so it'd be good to show the procedure in reasonable detail to allay fears.</p></div>

<p class="outstanding">Some patients receive tunneled catheters, others are non-tunneled. We want to come up with a description of the catheter fitting that is general, then refer the patient to more detailed information in an accompanying guide.</p>

The placement of the catheter should take about 30 minutes. First, an IV line will be started and you will be given medication through your IV line to make you sleepy. Your blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and oxygen levels will be monitored during your procedure.

A small area near your collarbone will be numbed with a local anesthetic. Depending on the type of catheter recommended for you either one or two small incisions (surgical cuts) will be made near your collarbone, usually at the base of your neck. These incisions will be used to gain access to a vein where the catheter will be inserted. 

Once the catheter has been inserted into your chest the incisions near will be stitched closed. The stitches will be absorbed and will not need to be removed. The outside of your incision will be covered with strips of adhesive tape. Your catheter will be stitched to your skin at the point where it exits your body so that it will stay in position. You will be able to see this thread around your catheter. 

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: A diagram or photograph of the catheter in place. </p></div>

#### After Your Catheter Has Been Inserted
After your catheter has been inserted you will be monitored in the Surgical Day Hospital for 2-3 hours before being allowed to return to your hotel or apartment. 

You will need to leave the dressings covering the incision near your collarbone in place and dry for <span class="outstanding notblock">48 hours</span>. You can remove these dressings after two days and can leave the site of the incision open to the air. The strips of adhesive tape that cover the incision should be left in place until they start to peel off. This should happen about 3 to 5 days after your catheter is inserted.

The point where the catheter exits your skin will still need to be covered with a dressing. The stitch at this site keeps your catheter in place until the cuff becomes fully anchored.

If you have discomfort at your incision sites or around the cuff ask your nurse for medication to relieve your pain.

#### Taking Care of Your Catheter
Taking good care of your catheter is important. When you visit the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day the nurse will change your catheter dressing, change the caps on the lumens and flush your catheter. When you are in your hotel, apartment or home (and anywhere else away from the Outpatient BMT Clinic) you are responsible for caring for your catheter.

A nurse will teach you how to care for your catheter. You will learn how to change your dressing while ensuring that it remains free from germs; this is known as "sterile technique". Using sterile technique will minimize your risk for infection. Your caregiver will learn how to change your dressing with you.

The nurse will also give you supplies including clean dressings, gauze pads, lumen caps, tape, clamps and other essentials. 

Your catheter should not interfere with your day to day activities as you get ready for your transplant, but you should avoid strenuous activities and contact sports. 

Prepare the following emergency kit and keep it with you at all times: 

* Two catheter caps
* One toothless clamp
* Alcohol swabs
* One roll of 2-inch tape
* Two 2 &times; 2 gauze pads
* Your doctor's office and emergency telephone numbers.

Here is a summary of the things you'll do on to take care of your catheter:

* Change the Tegaderm<span class="superscript">&trade;</span> dressing once a week
* Change the caps on the lumens and flush the catheter twice a week
* Use the small white clamps on each lumen of the catheter to clamp the catheter closed when it is not in use.
* Use a waterproof cover, called an Aquaquard<span class="superscript">&trade;</span>, over your catheter when showering or bathing
* Avoid submerging the catheter in water (e.g. in a swimming pool)
* Keep your catheter secure, avoid pulling it or the lumens.
* Tape the lumens to your skin, pin them to your clothing, or tape them to your bra if you're a woman. 

#### Problems with your Catheter
You and your caregiver should be on the look-out for any problems with your catheter. Infection is the most serious complication to watch out for. Look at the catheter site daily. Notify your doctor, NP or nurse if you experience any of the following:

* Redness, swelling and/or drainage (a liquid that can vary in color but may be clear, bloody or green/yellowish) at the exit site
* Pain or tenderness at the site where the catheter is inserted into your chest
* Temperature greater than 100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C.
* Flu-like symptoms or chills

Other complications may be related to the catheter itself. Notify your doctor, nurse practitioner or nurse if you experience any of the following:

* You see a hole or break in the catheter
* Swelling in your face, neck or arm on the same side of your body as the catheter

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Clamping the catheter above a leak.</p></div>

If your catheter is leaking at any time, clamp it above the leak. Use the white catheter clamp on the catheter, if possible. Wipe the area that is leaking with an alcohol pad and then cover the leak with tape. Follow the instructions in your BMT Emergency Guide (included at the back of this guide); if it is between 8am and 8pm call the BMT Outpatient Clinic. If it is after 8pm call your attending physician or go directly to the urgent care center.

Full instructions on how to care for your catheter are included in **Caring for Your Central Venous Catheter** which is included at the end of this guide. You should read it in full and refer to it when you are changing your dressing or caring for your catheter.

## Phase 2 - Your Chemotherapy and Transplant
<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Diagram of the transplant process/timeline with a "you are here" marker on Phase Two, or highlighting of some kind.</p></div>

### One Page Summary of This Phase
There are two main activities in this second phase of your journey. You'll receive your high-dose chemotherapy and on Day 0 your stem cells will be taken from storage and infused back into your body through your catheter. 

These are the key things that will happen during this phase:

* Conditioning Regimen - You'll receive high dose chemotherapy to kill your cancer. The chemotherapy will also kill the cells in your blood and damage your immune system. 
* Learn about Side Effects - The side effects of chemotherapy are significant. Take time to learn about the side effects you'll experience by reading this guide in full along with accompanying information.
* Monitoring Temperature and Fluid Intake - Your caregiver will take your temperature every four hours and will monitor how much you drink. Your caregiver will record this information in a diary. Your healthcare team will check this information when you and your caregiver come to the clinic.
* Learn About Sexuality and Transplant - Learn about the impact that treatment and transplantation can have on your sexuality.
* Rest Day (Day −1) - You will rest on the day before your transplant
* Transplantation (Day 0) - Your stem cells will be taken from storage and thawed. They will then be infused into your body through your catheter. This is your transplant.

We cover each of these activities in detail later in this section.

### The Conditioning Regimen - Receiving Your Chemotherapy
Conditioning regimen is another name for the high dose chemotherapy that you will receive prior to the transplant. The specific regimen you receive will depend upon your disease, previous treatments and your specific transplant protocol or treatment plan.

The conditioning regimen starts on a negative numbered day. If you are receiving one single dose of chemotherapy your chemotherapy will start on day -2. Depending on your treatment plan you may have one or multiple days of chemotherapy. Your stem cell transplant always takes place on Day 0. Remember that every day after transplant is referred to as a positive numbered day (e.g. +1, +2 etc). 

<table>
<tr><th class="tfive">Day -2</th><th class="tfive">Day -1</th><th class="tfive">Day 0</th><th class="tfive">Day +1</th></tr>
<tr><td>Conditioning Regimen (chemotherapy)</td><td>Rest Day</td><td>Stem Cell Infusion</td><td>Start of Supportive Care</td></tr>
</table>

Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will work with you to plan your schedule and will provide you with a treatment calendar. The BMT Nurse Coordinator will tell you the date, time and location of your treatment.

#### The Morning before Chemotherapy - The Outpatient BMT Clinic
On the morning of your treatment you and your caregiver will make your first of your regular visits to the Outpatient BMT Clinic. (You'll return to the clinic each day until your healthcare team tell you otherwise.)

You should bring these items to the clinic with you:

* A list of all prescription and non-prescription medications you are taking with dosages and frequency. This should include vitamins, nutritional supplements, herbal products and over-the-counter drugs. 
* A notebook to write down key pieces of information and any questions you or your caregiver might have.

You can expect to be in the BMT Clinic for 6 to 10 hours, so you might want to bring newspapers, books, a laptop or tablet computer - things to pass the time. While you're at the clinic you'll be provided with meals and there is a lounge with coffee and tea for caregivers.

You and your caregiver should arrive at the Outpatient BMT Clinic at MSKCC's main campus at 8am. You should wear comfortable, loose everyday clothes - loose fitting tops or shirts that open to the front (so that we can access your catheter), comfortable pants (sweat pants or track suit). 

Once you arrive at the BMT Outpatient Clinic you will be brought to your own private room. A nurse practitioner will review your medical history and ask you a set of questions about how you're feeling. Your vital signs will be checked and you will be weighed. 

Once you have been fully evaluated you will meet with the Clinical Pharmacist. The Pharmacist will explain the medications you will take throughout your treatment and will show you how to use your pill box. The Pharmacist will give you all the medications that you need to take. The Pharmacist will give you a medication list that tells you when to take each different medication. 

#### Receiving Chemotherapy
Once you have been evaluated and the Pharmacist has talked through your medications you'll receive your chemotherapy. Before you receive your chemotherapy it goes through a number of safety checks to make sure everything is correct. 

* Your chemotherapy is ordered by your doctor
* A nurse checks your chemotherapy order
* A pharmacist checks your chemotherapy order
* A pharmacist checks your blood test results
* Your chemotherapy is prepared in the Pharmacy
* A pharmacist performs a comprehensive final check of your chemotherapy
* Your chemotherapy is picked up by your chemotherapy nurse
* 2 chemotherapy nurses check to make sure your chemotherapy order, blood test results, and chemotherapy are correct

Once all the safety checks have been complete the nurse will administer fluids (to keep you hydrated), anti-nausea medication and the chemotherapy drug through your catheter.

During your chemotherapy your healthcare team will use this time to talk to you about the rest of your transplant journey. 

The healthcare team will make sure that the logistics of the next few days are clear - what happens on transplant day and what happens after your transplant. 

They will talk to you about the side effects you'll start to experience after your chemotherapy. You'll be given printed materials that explain these side effects in detail and you'll be shown what to do if you need to get help while you are in your apartment/hotel.

#### Side Effects of Chemotherapy
Your chemotherapy will kill the cancerous cells in your body and will prepare your bone marrow to receive your transplant. However, the side effects associated with chemotherapy are not to be taken lightly. These side effects will include the loss of your ability to heal and fight infections, infertility, hair loss, fatigue, nausea, mouth sores and mouth tenderness. 

Your healthcare team will help you understand and prepare for these side effects. Before you receive your chemotherapy make a list of questions that you would like to ask about these side effects. Talk through these questions with your caregiver and your healthcare team. 

#### Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Neutropenia and Low Platelet Level
Your chemotherapy will severely damage your ability to fight infections and heal - it's important that you understand why this happens, how to watch for danger signs, and how to avoid infections and injuries.

One side effect of chemotherapy is called "neutropenia". Neutropenia is a condition where you have a a lower than normal number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in your bloodstream. Neutrophils play a crucial role in your immune system - they are one of the first types of cells that travel to the site of an infection. Once they reach the site of an infection they ingest and fight potentially harmful microorganisms. 

Because your chemotherapy will kill your stem cells, you will lose the ability to make new neutrophils. Because your neutrophils are not being replaced the number of neutrophils in your bloodstream will drop to a very low level, leaving you at high risk of infections. You and your caregiver will work together to watch for any sign of infection. You'll keep a record of your temperature even when you are in your hotel or apartment and you will have to take very careful precautions to avoid infections. 

In addition to losing your ability to make neutrophils and other types of white blood cells, you'll also lose your ability to make **platelets**. Platelets clump together to help stop bleeding. Because you will have a very low platelet count after your chemotherapy you will need to take special care to avoid cuts and strenuous activities that might cause bleeding. You need to take special care of your gums and mouth, because it's quite common for bleeding to start here.

After your transplant your healthcare team will take samples of your blood each day to count the number of neutrophils and platelets in your bloodstream. 

As your stem cells take hold and start to make new blood cells the number of neutrophils in your bloodstream (sometimes referred to as your Absolute Neutrophil Count or ANC) will increase, as will your number of platelets (called your platelet count) - these are collectively known as "your counts" and they are key signs that your transplant has worked. You'll hear the term "counts" used frequently by your healthcare team. 

More in-depth guides to living with neutropenia and low platelet levels are included later in this guide under Phase 3: After Your Transplant.

#### Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Diarrhea
Diarrhea is frequent, loose, watery bowel movements. Diarrhea can also cause stomach cramps, gas, and pain in the stomach or rectal area. Diarrhea can be caused by cancer treatments, medications, infection, stress or other medical conditions. If you are having diarrhea you may become dehydrated due to loss of fluids and electrolytes. If your diarrhea continues for more than 24 hours call your doctor or nurse practitioner. Medications are available to treat diarrhea – do not take any over the counter medication until evaluated by your nurse practitioner or doctor.

#### Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Constipation
Constipation is the passage of dry, hard stool that occurs when materials move too slowly through the large intestine. The normal length of time between bowel movements varies for each person. If you are having fewer bowel movements than what is normal for you or if you haven't moved your bowels for more than two days you are constipated. There are many causes of constipation -- some causes include not drinking enough fluids or eating enough fiber, a decrease in your activity – not moving around or walking enough and side effects of certain medications and chemotherapy drugs. Medications are available to treat constipation. Talk with your nurse practitioner or doctor if you haven't had a bowel movement for 2 days.

#### Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Mouth Sores
Some chemotherapy drugs affect the rapidly dividing cells that line the mouth and digestive tract. This is known as mucositis. Mucositis can cause redness, swelling, tenderness and sores on the lining of your mouth, tongue and lips. You also may experience some mouth and throat discomfort that may make it difficult to eat or swallow.

#### Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Skin Changes
Skin changes are common after transplant due to the effects of cancer treatment. Skin changes include increased dryness, flaking, discoloration and darkening. Your skin will be very sensitive to sun exposure and may sunburn very easily. Avoid bright sunlight and when outdoors wear sun block (SPF 30), protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts, long pants and a hat.

#### Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Hair Loss
The chemotherapy that kills your rapidly-dividing cancer cells also kills the rapidly-dividing cells that produce your hair. Most patients will lose their hair during their transplant. 

Losing your hair can be an unpleasant, upsetting experience. Like many patients, you might choose to cut your hair short before your transplant to take control of this process and to lessen the shock of losing your hair. Talk this through with your caregiver, friends and family.

Before your transplant is also a good time to think about whether you would like to wear a wig. Modern wigs can look very natural and wearing one might make you feel more comfortable. There are many wig stores in New York, a list of them is provided at the back of this guide. You can one while you still have your hair, or with a clipping of your hair, if you'd like your wig to match your natural hair. 

#### Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Fatigue
After your chemotherapy the number of red blood cells (RBCs) in your blood will be very low. 

Red blood cells are the cells that transport oxygen around your body. Because the number of red blood cells in your blood will be low, oxygen will not travel around your body as easily as before. This will mean that you will feel tired. Your caregiver will need to help you carry out day to day activities until your red blood cell count returns to normal. Don't be afraid to ask for help, even with things you used to do with ease.

Even though you will feel tired after your chemotherapy and your transplant, you should still try to remain active - we have recommended some exercises and activities that you can do in section three. 

#### Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Nausea and Vomiting
Nausea and vomiting is a common side effect of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy acts on a specific part of your brain that may trigger nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can also be caused by stress or just the thought of having chemotherapy. The amount of nausea and vomiting you have will depend on your past experience and the type of chemotherapy you will receive. Sometimes you may experience nausea during your chemotherapy treatment or it may be delayed for several hours or days. It is important to manage nausea because it can keep you from eating and drinking.

You will be given medication to prevent and control nausea prior to receiving chemotherapy. In addition you will be given a prescription for anti-nausea medication to take home with you. These medications work differently for each person. If the medication you are taking isn't helping tell your nurse practitioner or doctor. You may need to try a different medication or take more than one kind of anti-nausea medication to feel better. Your healthcare team will work with you to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting.

#### Side Effects from Chemotherapy - The Importance of Communication
Throughout your treatment it's very important that you communicate clearly with your healthcare team and your caregiver about your side effects. 

Tell your healthcare team how you're feeling. Describe how your body feels. Describe how you're doing emotionally. Tell them if anything is worrying you. If you notice changes in how you feel describe what has changed. If anything bothers you, even if it seems minor, tell your healthcare team. The more information you can communicate to your healthcare team the more they'll be able to help you. There is usually something that they can do to make you feel more comfortable. 

#### Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Changes to Sexual Activity
Sexual intimacy provides pleasure and intimacy for many people. The information below can serve as a guide to being sexually active in a safe way after your transplant. You may have questions or concerns regarding your sexual activity. You are encouraged to discuss your concerns openly with your physician, NP or nurse.

##### Birth Control
Although infertility is likely you or your partner should use contraception (birth control) throughout and after your cancer treatment. If a woman becomes pregnant with sperm or eggs damaged by exposure to radiation, chemotherapy or other anticancer medications there is a risk of miscarriage or birth defects.

It is important to pick a method of birth control that fits your lifestyle but will also be effective. Condoms used correctly are very effective in preventing pregnancy. Women can speak with their gynecologists to choose between the many available options.

##### Precautions to Observe to Avoid Exposing Your Partner to Chemotherapy and Other Anticancer Medications
There is little information about how much anticancer medication gets into a person's body fluids, and even less on whether this poses any risk to a sexual partner. If this is a concern to you, consider using a barrier device whenever your partner may have contact with your semen (if you are male) or vaginal fluids (if you are female). Barrier devices include condoms and dental dams. We don't know how long these medications may be in body fluids, but you could use barrier devices each day you have chemotherapy and for 1 week afterward.
##### Protecting Yourself from Infection or Bleeding
You will be at increased risk of infection during your transplant period and for many months after your treatment.

Until your doctor tells you that your blood counts and immune system have recovered follow these precautions:

* Avoid sex that involves penetration or contact with mucous membranes while your blood counts are low (your platelet count needs to be greater than 50,000). This includes vaginal, oral, and anal sex or inserting fingers, vibrators or sex toys into your vagina or anus.
* Use latex condoms each time you have vaginal, oral or anal sex.
* Use a barrier device (condoms or dental dams) any time your partner's saliva, vaginal secretions or semen could enter your mouth.
* Abstain from any sexual activity that could expose your mouth to feces.
* Avoid sex that involves contact with mucous membranes if a genital infection is suspected or present in either you or your partner.Hugging, cuddling, gentle touching, and kissing skin are other ways you can be intimate with your partner during this time. For additional information about being sexually active during and after treatment see the additional resources at the back of this guide:
* Sexual Activity During Cancer Treatment: Information for Women* Sexual Activity During Cancer Treatment: Information for Men
* Sexual Health and IntimacyThe American Cancer Society publishes 2 well written books on sexuality following cancer treatment. They are available free of charge from your local American Cancer Society:
* Sexuality for the Man with Cancer and His Partner
* Sexuality for the Woman with Cancer and Her Partner

### Rest Day 
After your first day at the Outpatient Clinic and your chemotherapy you will return to your local hotel or apartment. 

The day between your chemotherapy and your transplant day is a rest day. This rest day allows the chemotherapy drug to work and then leave your body. When you receive your stem cells there will be no trace of the chemotherapy drug in your body, so the transplanted stem cells will not be harmed.

### Monitoring Temperature and Fluid Intake
From the time you receive your chemotherapy your caregiver must take your temperature every four hours and write it in the "Temperature and Oral Intake Diary". 

If your temperature is 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher your caregiver needs follow the instructions on your BMT Emergency Guide; if it is between 8am and 8pm call the Outpatient BMT Clinic at (212) 639-2399. If it is after 8pm call (212) 639-2000 and ask for the doctor covering bone marrow transplant.

It's really important that you drink a lot of fluids from now on. As well as taking your temperature your caregiver will also monitor all of the fluids you drink and record the volume you drink in the Intake Diary. You should drink 2 liters or 64 fluid ounces of fluids each day. Try to drink steadily throughout the day; little and often.

Your caregiver should bring the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary to the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day. A nurse practitioner will review the diary with you. 

### Transplant Day
Now that you've received chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells in your body, it's time for your stem cell infusion - your transplant. On Day 0 of your specific treatment plan the stem cells that were separated from your blood and frozen earlier will be re-infused into your body. These stem cells will give you back your ability to make new blood cells and fight infections. 

#### The Morning Before Transplant
On the morning of Day 0, your transplant day, you and your caregiver should come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic at MSKCC's main campus at 8am. Give yourself extra time to get to the clinic, as you may feel tired after your chemotherapy. 

You should bring these items to the clinic with you:

* A list of all prescription and non-prescription medications you are taking with dosages and frequency. This should include vitamins, nutritional supplements, herbal products and over-the-counter drugs. 
* A notebook to write down key pieces of information and any questions you or your caregiver might have.
* The Temperature and Oral Intake diary you and your caregiver have been using to record your temperature and fluid intake.
* Newspapers, books, a laptop or tablet computer to pass the time.

Once you arrive at the BMT Outpatient Clinic a nurse practitioner will review your Temperature and Oral Intake diary and will ask you a set of questions. You will be brought to a private room for a physical exam and your vital signs will be checked.

#### Your Stem Cell Infusion
Before the stem cell infusion, your "transplant", your frozen stem cells will be removed from storage in the stem cell laboratory and brought to your room. The stem cells are stored in clear plastic bags that look like a bag of blood. The bags will be placed in a warm water bath to thaw. 

You will be given medications about 30 minutes before your transplant to help reduce any side effects effects that you may experience during the infusion. 

Once the stem cells are thawed, the nurse practitioner or doctor will infuse the stem cells into your body through your catheter. You will be closely observed and your vital signs will be checked frequently during and after the infusion. 

You may experience some side-effects during and after the infusion. The common side effects are nausea, vomiting, a tickle in your throat, or a cough. Other side-effects that can occur include low blood pressure, chills and fever. 

It's important that you communicate with the healthcare team and with your caregiver during your transplant. Let your healthcare team know how you're feeling and tell them if you experience any side effects. If you do experience side-effects then your healthcare team will treat your symptoms. 

During and after your transplant you may notice a strong, garlic-like taste in your mouth. Your urine, sweat, and skin may also have a garlic-like smell. You may not notice the smell but those around you will. This smell is caused by the preservative used to store your stem cells and will gradually go away over 1 to 2 days. The Nutrition Department will give you lemons to cut up and use as safe, natural air-fresheners. 

#### After Your Transplant
After your stem cells are infused through your catheter you will remain in your hospital room for 4-6 hours for observation. After that you will be allowed to return home to your hotel or apartment to rest. 

Your urine may appear bloody for 24 hours after your stem cells are infused into your body. This is your body's way of getting rid of the byproducts of the stem cells that are not needed.  

<div class="phasedivider">End of Phase 2 Divider</div>

<p class="dmz">Final Draft - This is where I am right now. Everything after this is content from an older draft. </p>

## Phase 3 - After Your Transplant
<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Diagram of the transplant process/timeline with a "you are here" marker on Phase Three, or highlighting of some kind.</p></div>

### One Page Summary of This Phase
Now that you've had your transplant, you enter a period of watching and waiting for your stem cells to begin producing new blood, a process called engraftment. 

As engraftment occurs the number of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets in your blood will return to normal - the amount of these cells, called your "counts", will be monitored daily. 

After your transplant you will remain in a nearby apartment or hotel and will return to the BMT Clinic each day to have your progress evaluated and to have adjustments made to your treatment. 

These are the key things that will happen during this phase:

* Learn About Engraftment - The stem cells that have been re-infused into your body find their way to your bone marrow, fix in place and begin to make new blood. This is called engraftment. You should read about this process and make a note of any questions you have.
* Return to the Outpatient BMT Clinic - You will make daily visits to the Outpatient BMT Clinic until your healthcare team advise otherwise.
* Side Effects - You will experience a range of side effects associated with your chemotherapy and transplant. 

We cover each of these topics in detail later in this section.

### Engraftment
Almost immediately after your stem cells are infused into your body they will travel through your bloodstream into your bone marrow. Once the stem cells arrive in your bone marrow they will begin to engraft. Engraftment is when your body accepts the transplant and your white blood cell count returns.White blood cell engraftment usually occurs about 10-14 days following your transplant, but this may vary depending upon your disease and exact treatment. Platelets and red blood cells usually take a little longer to recover than white blood cells. 

Each day when you return to the Outpatient BMT Clinic you will have blood drawn. This blood will be analyzed and the different types of cells in your blood will be counted. When your stem cells engraft and start to divide the number of white, red and platelet cells will increase. 

During the time that you are waiting for engraftment you may need to have blood and platelet transfusions. You'll be given injections of growth factor - drugs that will speed up the production of white blood cells in your body. 

Remember, you will be very vulnerable to infection at this time. You will need to take precautions including avoiding sources of infection, washing your hands regularly and eating a low-microbial diet. You will be closely monitored for any signs of infections. 

As your cells start to engraft you mary experience bone pain or a rash on your body.

### The Outpatient BMT Clinic
You will receive all your care in the outpatient BMT clinic on a daily basis. Each morning you will return to the Outpatient BMT Clinic. You should arrive at 8am. You will remain at the clinic for most of the day. Bring newspapers, books, a laptop or tablet computer or other things to pass the time. 

When you come to the clinic you should wear every-day, comfortable clothing that allows for easy access to your catheter; shirts that open at the front, sweatshirts, large t-shirts. Nothing that is too difficult to take off or put back on again. 

You should bring these items to the clinic with you each day:

* A list of all prescription and non-prescription medications you are taking with dosages and frequency. This should include vitamins, nutritional supplements, herbal products and over-the-counter drugs. 
* All the prescription medications you were instructed to take during the bone marrow transplant period.
* Your temperature and oral intake record

Once you arrive you will check in with the session assistant. A nurse practitioner will sit with you and your caregiver and you'll be asked a series of questions about how you feel. The nurse practitioner will check the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary.

Once you've checked in, you'll be brought to an examination room where you'll be examined physically and your vital signs will be checked.

Some of your blood will be taken and sent for testing. Your blood will be checked to see how your white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets are recovering. Your blood will also be checked for any signs of infection such as the presence of harmful bacteria or viruses. 

<p class="question">Any details we can add here would be great. What happens during clinic visits. If you can bullet I can write up.</p>

Once you've been examined you will wait in the Outpatient BMT Clinic for your test results to return. This can take several hours. This is a good time for your caregiver to take a break; he or she can take some personal time or run errands. You will be safe in the care of the Outpatient BMT team. We highly recommend that caregivers leave the hospital and take this time to unwind.

After several hours, your test results (sometimes referred to as "labs") will come back from the lab. Your healthcare team will analyze the results and will make decisions about your care. The rest of your visit to the Outpatient BMT Clinic that day will depend on the results of your tests. 

Here are some things that can happen based on the results of your tests:

* You could be given fluids to hydrate you
* You could be given an infusion of platelets, red blood cells or other blood components
* Your medication could be changed 
* Your treatment could be left as-is

All of this will be explained to you. You'll remain in the clinic until any actions the healthcare team have recommended have been completed. Once your healthcare team is happy, you'll be free to leave. You'll return to your apartment or hotel where your caregiver will continue to monitor your temperature and fluid intake. 

You'll continue to make daily visits to the clinic until your healthcare team decide that you can come less regularly. 

If at any time you need more care than can be provided to you in the outpatient clinic you will be admitted to the inpatient BMT unit.

#### Visitor Information
<p class="outstanding">Reword this.</p>
This information should be reviewed by your caregiver and any other visitors who are planning to come and see you during your transplant.

* No visitors are allowed who have any signs of a cold, flu or who have been exposed to any contagious illness. If you have any questions about who can visit please speak with a nurse, NP or physician.
* Hand washing for 15-20 seconds is required before each visitor enters a patient's room. Hand washing or use of a hand sanitizer (Purell&reg;) must be repeated each time the room is entered. There may be a need for additional precautions at other times – if needed there will be a sign on the patient's door with instructions.
* Visitors and caregivers must use the visitor's restroom in the hallway. This is for the protection of the patient and to minimize bacterial spread in the room.
* No fresh cut flowers or live plants are allowed in the patient's room.
* Children under the age of 12 are not allowed to visit or stay with you during your transplant period.

### Living with Neutropenia
As you know, your chemotherapy will kill not only the cancerous cells in your body, but also healthy stem cells that make the different types of cells in your blood. This is why you received a transplant. 

Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, play a crucial role in your immune system. In the days and weeks after your transplant, while your transplanted stem cells are still engrafting, you will have a very low number of neutrophils in your bloodstream. This will leave you highly susceptible to infections. 

You and your caregiver will take careful precautions to avoid infections while you are "neutropenic". These precautions will include eating a special, low-microbial diet (a diet that contains a low number of potentially harmful microorganisms), washing carefully, taking care of your mouth and other precautions. 

#### Avoiding Sources of Infection
One of the best ways to avoid infection is to simply avoid sources of infection. This is easier said than done - you and your caregiver will need to be careful about seeing visitors, what you touch, where you go. While you are neutropenic you should try to **avoid**:

* Shaking hands with people. When you do shake hands with people use an antibacterial gel, such as Purell<span class="superscript">&reg;</span> afterwards
* Contact with young children, including your children if they are under 12
* Contact with animals, including your pets - they cannot stay with you during your transplant
* Contact with soil or dirt - you should not keep any plants in your hotel or apartment and should not accept gifts of flowers or plants
* Contact with people who have had colds or recent illnesses

Telling people who love you and want to make sure that you're okay that you can't see them can be difficult, but you and your caregiver need to be vigilant. You can explain to them that it's just for a short period of time, and that by taking these precautions you are making sure that you can see them as soon as possible. They will understand.

We strongly recommend that you use a computer or tablet and programs like Skype, Google Talk/Hangouts, FaceTime to keep in touch with friends and family when you are neutropenic. 

#### Eating a Low-Microbial Diet
After your chemotherapy, and until told otherwise by your healthcare team, you will need to eat what is called a low-microbial diet. This is a diet for people with weakened immune systems and low blood counts. A low microbial diet is a diet that contains fewer microbes (also called microorganisms) than would ordinarily be found in every-day foods. This diet helps to reduce the risk of food-borne illnesses caused by bacteria and other microbes found in some foods and drinks. Microbes are tiny living organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, yeast, and molds. 

Microbes can attach to foods and grow, but you can't always see, smell, or taste them. They are more likely to grow on milk, unrefrigerated food, undercooked foods, certain fruits and vegetables, unpasteurized juices and vegetable sprouts - but in reality they can grow on any food. 

Eating a diet that contains fewer microbes will help prevent you from getting sick. 

You will need to take careful precautions with the food you eat, including:

* Buying foods that you know have been stored properly and are safe to eat
* Storing food safely in your hotel or apartment
* Keeping your kitchen very clean
* Keeping your refrigerator clean
* Handling food safely
* Eating only food that you know has been prepared and cooked in keeping with a low-microbial diet
* Cooking foods thoroughly

Refer to the guide on "Low-microbial Diet and Safe Food Handling" at the back of this guide. 

#### Connecting with Children
<p class="outstanding">Move this, or discuss this topic early in the guide.</p>
Children under 12 are not able to visit you during your transplant period because of the risk of infection. This separation will be difficult for you, your child, and the rest of your family. We know from past experience that patients with children experience a range of feelings and reactions related to this separation. 

We strongly recommend that you take time to talk to one of the social workers about being separated from your children. You or your caregiver should ask your Nurse Practitioner, BMT Nurse Coordinator or any member of the healthcare team that you'd like to speak with one of the social workers and they will make sure to come and see you. 

Here are some things that other patients have done to remain in contact with their children during their transplant.

* Use a computer or tablet and programs like Skype, Google Talk/Hangouts, FaceTime to talk to your children regularly. Set up a time that you talk to them each day - like when they get home from school and before they go to bed. Get into a routine of using the computer to see them and talk to them. 
* Paint or create other crafts to send home. Craft supplies can be provided to you by the Patient Recreation Center. Ask one of your healthcare team to arrange for the Patient Recreation Center to bring supplies to you.
* Use your phone to make an audio recording of yourself as you read your children's favorite stories. Upload these recordings to the web, give them to your caregiver, or e-mail them to your children. They can read along with these stories while listening to your voice.
* Keep copies of your children's favorite stories with you in your apartment or hotel. At night you can use Skype to read along with them before they go to sleep. 
* Ask your children to decorate your apartment or hotel with pictures; your caregiver can bring them to you and you can show them hanging on the wall to your children over Skype.
* Give your child a special coloring book or journal for times when they miss you are feelings are difficult. Your caregiver can bring the colorings to you. You can talk to your child about them over Skype or the phone.

We understand that nothing will replace physical contact between you and your children, but we strongly encourage you to use all available technology and means at your disposal to maintain a strong bond with them while you are unable to see them due to your neutropenia.

#### Showering and Bathing
While you are neutropenic keeping yourself clean is very important. 

You should shower or bathe daily. When you shower or bathe you should use soap that can kill germs. Look for the words "antibacterial" or "antimicrobial". Dial<span class="superscript">&reg;</span> is one example, but there are many others. 

When you shower or bathe take extra care to make sure you wash yourself thoroughly. Begin with your upper body, then the middle section, and wash the lower area including your feet last. Wash carefully under your arms, in your anal and genital areas, and in any skin folds. Germs tend to live in these moist areas. You may shampoo your scalp with soap once a day. 

After you urinate or move your bowels, wash your buttocks and genital area with antibacterial soap. You can also use moist wipes. Pat the area dry. Wash your hands well afterward.

When you wash or bathe take care of your catheter; detailed instructions on how to protect your catheter against water are included at the back of this guide. 

#### Mouth Care
While you're neutropenic and have a low platelet count you will need to change the way you brush your teeth and care for your mouth. This will help to avoid infection and bleeding.

Follow these guidelines to take good care of your mouth:

* You will be given a mouthwash to rinse your mouth before and after meals and at bedtime. The number of rinses may be increased to every 2 hours, depending on how your mouth feels.
* Use only the mouthwash that your nurse gives you. Do not use mouthwash or toothpaste from any store. These products irritate and dry the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat.
* Use an ultra soft toothbrush. You may also use Toothettes<span class="superscript">&reg;</span> disposable foam sticks.
* Do not use dental floss.
* Avoid licking your lips. It increases drying and chapping.
* Apply a lubricant like Chapstick <span class="superscript">&reg;</span> after you clean or rinse your mouth and every 2 to 4 hours as needed. This will help keep your lips moist.
* To avoid an infection in your mouth, the doctor will prescribe an oral anti-fungal antibiotic.
* If your mouth becomes sensitive, avoid hot, spicy, acidic, or coarse foods. You may prefer soft or liquid food served chilled or at room temperature.
* If your mouth feels very painful, your doctor will prescribe medicine for the pain.

### Living with a Low Platelet Count
Platelets are little fragments of larger cells made in your bone marrow; they break off from these larger cells and flow through your bloodstream. They clump together to help stop bleeding. Because you will have a very low platelet count after your chemotherapy you and your caregiver will take special precautions:

* Avoid sharp objects such as a razors, scissors, and nail clippers. You should only shave using an electric razor/shaver and not a razor that has a blade
* Do not have manicures, pedicures, waxes, electrolysis or tattoos
* Do not have any dental work done
* Follow the guidelines on mouth care (above)
* Do not use rectal suppositories, enemas, or tampons
* Do not take your temperature rectally
* Consider using stool softeners or laxatives if you are straining to have bowel movements
* Avoid tight clothing or any clothing that you have to strain to put on or take off

You should avoid any activity that may result in injury. This includes any:

* Contact sports
* Climbing ladders
* Strenuous exercise
* Bicycling
* Weight lifting

You should take precautions when you are having sex. You should use lubrication if needed and avoid anal or oral intercourse. Avoid strong thrusting as this can cause bleeding. 

<p class="question">Are these guidelines correct? I had thought that barrier method contraception had to be used as well for BMT patients. These are the generic low platelet guidelines and as such might not cover auto BMT.</p>

You should avoid medications that have not been explicitly prescribed to you by your medical team. Do not take:

* Aspirin or products that contain aspirin
* Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Advil<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>
* Vitamin E

All of these drugs make it more difficult for your blood to clot and so are very dangerous for somebody like you with a limited ability to heal and clot.

Call your doctor if you develop any symptoms of bleeding. Be on the lookout for:

* Excessive bruising
* A faint red rash on your trunk, arms or legs
* Vaginal spotting or heavy menstrual bleeding
* The appearance of broken blood vessels in the white of your eye

If you notice that you are bleeding you should take these steps immediately:

1. Apply direct pressure on the bleeding site.
2. After applying pressure, follow the BMT Emergency Guide; if it is between 8am and 8pm call the BMT Outpatient Clinic at (212) 639-2399. If it is after 8pm call (212) 639-2000 and ask for the doctor covering bone marrow transplant.
3. Apply ice over the bridge of your nose for nosebleeds.

Call your doctor immediately if you:

* Have black bowel movements, blood in the stool, or rectal bleeding
* Have blood in your urine
* Have a headache that do not get better, blurred vision, or dizziness
* Cough up blood, vomit blood or get a nose bleeds

### Living with a Low Red Blood Cell Count (Anemia)
Red blood cells carry oxygen to the tissues. We breathe in oxygen from the air and breathe out carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin in red blood cells carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues in all parts of the body. It then carries carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. 

Your chemotherapy will cause you to have a very low red blood cell count, a condition known as anemia. When your red blood cell count is low your body cannot carry oxygen as well. Anemia can make you feel tired and weak. You may also feel dizzy or lightheaded when changing positions quickly lying to standing. 

Some of the side effects of anemia include:

* Increased tiredness
* Generalized weakness
* Rapid heartbeat
* Shortness of breath
* Headache
* Pale skin

If you have anemia, your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following:

* A transfusion
* Rest
* A diet high in iron (e.g., green leafy vegetables, liver, chicken)
* Iron supplements

<p class="question">I assume that the diet/iron recommendations here don't apply to SCT patients?</p>

### Receiving a Transfusion
Your doctor may recommend a blood transfusion to boost the number of platelets or red blood cells in your body. 

If your doctor recommends a transfusion for you it will be given to you through your catheter during one of your regular visits to the Outpatient BMT Clinic. 

#### Sourcing Blood for Your Transfusion
The blood used in your transfusion is donated at our Blood Bank. There is no substitute for real blood, so we are incredibly grateful to the people who donate blood. 

Your friends and relatives may donate red blood cells and platelets - this is known as a directed donation. Your friends and relatives are eligible to donate if they:

* Are between 16 and 75 years old. No parental consent is required for those who are at least 17 years old.
* Weigh at least 110 pounds
* Are in good health
* Have not had an illness such as hepatitis, jaundice, cancer, etc
* Do not have signs of a cold or active allergy at the time of donation
* Have not taken aspirin, or any compound that has aspirin or aspirin-like drugs (Ibuprofen, Motrin<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>, Naprosyn<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>, Anaprox<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>, Advil<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>, Aleve<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>) within three days before giving blood.
* Have identification showing their name and photograph or signature
* Have not consumed alcohol eight hours before donating

Blood donations can be given by appointment at our Blood Donor Room which is located at:

Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
Schwartz Building Lobby
1250 First Avenue
(Between 67th and 68th Streets)
New York, NY 10065

For more information about making a directed donation and to make an appointment, your friends and family should call our Blood Donor Room at 212-639-7643.

If your friend of family member has a blood type that isn't compatible with yours then their blood will be released for use with other patients at MSKCC.

Directed donations will be held for you for 30 days. After that, the blood will be released for use with other patients at MSKCC.

#### Making Sure Blood Is Safe
After it is donated all blood is tested for:

* Syphilis
* Hepatitis B and C
* Exposure to the AIDS virus
* The presence of a virus associated with a very rare form of leukemia. 
* West Nile virus
* Trypanosoma Cruzi

The chance of getting any of these from donated blood is very small. Directed donations are tested in exactly the same way as other donations. 

#### How long does the Transfusion take?
A transfusion of red blood cells usually takes two to four hours. Transfusions of other blood components, like platelets, takes only 15-30 minutes. 

#### Are there risks associated with blood transfusions?
Yes, blood transfusions have some risks. These risks include the very slight chance of having an allergic reaction or acquiring an infection through tainted blood.

<p class="question">Are these risks worth mentioning?</p>

#### Can anything bad happen during or after the transfusion?
Transfusions sometimes cause reactions. The most common symptoms are fever, chills, and hives. These can be treated with a variety of medicines. Transfusion reactions are rarely life threatening. Nursing staff constantly check all patients while a blood transfusion is taking place.

#### Is there anything to worry about after a transfusion?
Allergic reactions can sometimes occur. Symptoms are listed below. They can occur up to 48 hours after the transfusion. Call your doctor immediately if you have:

* Fever (100.4 F or 38 C or higher) or chills.
* Flushing of the face. 
* Hives, rash, or itching.
* Trouble breathing or shortness of breath.
* Low back pain.
* Nausea or vomiting.
* Weakness or fainting.
* Blood in the urine.
* Chest pain (If you have chest pain, call your local emergency number immediately.).

### Exercise
Exercise is an important part of the recovery process during and following stem cell transplantation. Benefits of exercise include preventing loss of endurance, muscle strength and bone density. Exercise can also prevent respiratory and circulatory problems and improve your ability to be as independent as possible.

While in the outpatient transplant program you will be walking to and from the hospital daily which will help to maintain your conditioning. During the hours you are in clinic you are encouraged to walk in the hallways (wearing a mask and gloves) two to three times daily. While you are staying locally in the hotel you are encouraged to walk outside weather permitting. 

If you have special needs you will be seen by a physical therapist for an evaluation.
