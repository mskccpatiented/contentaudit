### Managing your Emotions
Learning that you may have a stem cell transplant can be a very emotional time for you and your loved ones, but there are things you can do and ways we can help.
Talk with your transplant team.
Fear of the disease, treatment, and even the unknown are common and normal. You may want to talk with your social worker, doctor, or nurse about your feelings. If you're feeling anxious or depressed, your doctor may prescribe a medication to help you deal with the stress. There are many resources available to you as a patient at MSKCC; you can find information about them in the Resources section of this guide.
Ask Questions.
Learning about your illness and transplant helps some people decrease fear of the unknown. The transplant process can be overwhelming because many things are happening. By making a list of your worries or questions, you can focus on just a couple of your concerns at a time. Your transplant team expects you to have questions and will answer them.
Share your feelings and thoughts.
Sharing how you feel with others and what you think about your transplant is another way that may decrease the burden. Some patients find this difficult because they don't want to worry their family and friends. However, not knowing how you feel or how to help may worry them even more. Sharing feelings and thoughts can bring people together at a time of stress. You may also ask your social worker about a support group that may be helpful.



### Exercise After Your Transplant
Being in the best physical health you can before your transplant will help you recover. Before your transplant, work with your doctor and/or physical therapist to develop an exercise plan that's right for you. Walking or doing some form of exercise every day will help prepare your body for transplant.

### Eating Well
When preparing for your transplant, eat a well- balanced diet high in protein, vitamins, and minerals. It's important to be in the best physical health you can be before your transplant because you will have difficulty eating during some periods of time during your transplant.

### Getting More Information
Different people look for different amounts of information about their cancer treatment. If you would like to know more than what is in this binder, there are a number of ways to get reliable information. Talking to your healthcare team
is the best way to get information about your treatment options. Many people also go to the internet. While the internet is a great resource for information, it is important to go to reliable sources. You can find websites suggested by the MSKCC staff on the LIBGUIDES section on MSKCC's website at www.mskcc.org. If you prefer, you can call the library reference staff at (212) 639-7439 for assistance finding reliable information.
Many patients find they collect a lot of information as they prepare for their transplant. Use this binder to organize the information in one place and write down any questions for your healthcare team. Remember to bring this binder with you to all your MSKCC appointments.







### Eating Well
During your transplant, your appetite may decrease. This is expected. You eat and drink
as much as you can without forcing yourself. Nutritional shakes or supplements can be helpful as you go through this period.
Your dietitian and nurse are here to help you when you are not able to eat as you usually do. By the time your treatment is complete, you will be able to drink enough liquids and eat small amounts
of food.

### Emotional Support
Being away from home for a long time, the slow recovery after transplant, and low energy may be frustrating. Dealing with your feelings can help you cope with treatment and feel better. You may want to talk with your social worker, doctor, or nurse about your feelings.

### Fatigue and Weakness


Emotional Recovery
Recovery takes time. Sometimes people feel isolated and alone. You might wonder if what you are feeling is normal, and your caregivers might wonder how to reassure you. Here are some things you can do:
* Discuss your experiences with your doctor or nurse. They can provide you with guidance about what to expect during recovery from transplant as well as what you can do to help.
* Talk with your social worker for support and counseling.
* Consider joining a support group. These
are available in person or on the Internet. Cancer Care (www.cancercare.org) and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (www.lls. org) are great resources. MSKCC's Resources for Life After Cancer program also has support groups, and they can be reached at (212) 888-4740.

Consider talking with someone else who
has been through transplant. The volunteer department here at MSKCC has patient volunteers. You can reach them at (212) 639- 5007. Cancer Care (www.cancercare.org) and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (www.lls.org) also offer these services.

Explore educational materials. The National Marrow Donor Program (www.marrow. org), The Bone Marrow Foundation (www. bonemarrow.org), Cancer Care (www. cancercare.org) and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (www.lls.org) also offer educational materials.
* The Counseling Center at MSKCC has psychologists and psychiatrists available for consultations, therapy, and treatment of
the depression and anxiety that you may experience after your transplant. They also offer family and couples counseling. You can reach them at (646) 888-0100.
Remember, you are not alone. Your transplant team has worked with many other patients and caregivers who have experienced similar feelings. It is normal to need guidance after transplant and communication is an important part of your recovery.
