<p>The skin is the body's largest organ and its first defense against injury and infection. This card is about what you can do to help protect your skin from developing pressure ulcers or sores. Share it with your family and friends. Your family, doctors, and nurses can all help you to prevent most pressure ulcers or sores. Ask for help if needed, when changing your position in bed or a chair, checking your skin, and caring for your skin.</p>

<h3>What is a pressure ulcer or sore?</h3>

<p>A pressure ulcer is an injury to the skin and the tissues under it. It is sometimes called a bedsore. The cause is unrelieved pressure on a bony area of the body, such as your tail bone, buttocks, or heels.
What are some risks for pressure ulcers?</p>

<ul>
<li>Lying in bed or sitting in a chair for long periods of time</li>
<li>Being unable to move by yourself</li>
<li>Losing bowel or bladder control</li>
<li>Having poor nutrition</li>
<li>Being less aware of what is going on around you</li>
</ul>


<h3>How can pressure ulcers be prevented?</h3>

<p>The following tips can help prevent pressure ulcers. Ask for help if necessary.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not lie in bed or sit in a chair in one position for long periods of time.</li>
<li>If you stay in bed, change your position at least every two hours. Raise the head of the bed as little as possible, unless your medical condition makes it unsafe to lay flat. This will put less pressure on your buttocks. Put pillows or foam wedges between your knees and ankles to keep them from touching. Also place a small pillow under your lower legs to keep your heels off the bed.</li>
<li>If you are in a wheelchair or must sit in a chair a lot, change your position at least each hour. Avoid doughnut- shape pillows. Sit on a regular pillow instead. If you need suggestions about a type of cushion, speak to your health care provider</li>
<li>Move often and change positions frequently. Even small shifts help. Lift, do not drag, your buttocks when changing position in a bed or chair.</li>
<li>Keep your skin clean and dry. Shower and bathe as necessary to reduce moisture from urine, stool, or perspiration.</li>
<li>Tell the nurse or doctor of any loss of bowel or bladder control.</li>
<li>Eat a well balanced diet and drink plenty of fluids if you are not medically restricted. Otherwise, speak with your health care provider. You need to eat well for your skin to stay healthy.</li>
<li>Do not rub or massage the skin over any bony parts of the body. This can hurt the skin and its sensitive tissue. To prevent dry skin, apply creams lightly without friction or pressure.</li>
<li>Check your skin at least once a day. Tell the doctor or nurse if you feel any pain or see areas that are red, cut, open or blistered.</li>
</ul>


<p>Share any concerns about the health of your skin with your doctor and nurses. They will work with you and give you more tips to help prevent pressure ulcers or sores.</p>
