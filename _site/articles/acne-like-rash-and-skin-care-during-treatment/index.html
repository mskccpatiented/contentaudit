<p><strong>Summary: </strong>Some chemotherapies can cause skin irritations. Describes those irritations and actions that the patient can take.</p> 


</div>
<p>Targeted treatments cause fewer side effects than chemotherapy. But, they can lead to skin problems. The skin problems are most often seen with the following targeted drugs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Erlotinib (Tarceva).</li>
<li>Cetuximab (Erbitux).</li>
<li>Panitumumab (Vectibix).</li>
<li>Lapatinib (Tykerb).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Skin Changes</h3>

<p>You may have none, any or all of the following symptoms.</p>

<h4>Acne-like rash on the face, chest and upper back</h4>

<p>The symptoms can range from mild discomfort with itching to pain that stops you from doing your usual activities. In most people the rash is mild to moderate and will not affect your daily life.</p>

<p>It may look like acne but it is not acne. It will not improve with anti-acne medicines. The rash will usually appear within the first months of treatment.</p>

<h4>Dry, scaly skin and itching on the scalp, trunk and arms and legs</h4>

<p>On the fingertips and heels, the dryness appears as cracks or fissures. Dry skin and itching may be uncomfortable enough to disrupt sleep. This usually appears after the second month of treatment.</p>

<h4>Painful swelling in the fingernails or toenails</h4>

<p>It may make it hard to pick up small things such as a pen or a fork. You may have trouble buttoning clothes. Some people have trouble putting on shoes. This usually appears after the fourth month of treatment.</p>

<h4>Hair curling or loss on the scalp</h4>

<p>It may include increased hair growth on the face, eyebrows or eyelashes. This usually appears after four months of treatment.
Between 50-90% of people will develop skin and hair changes to some degree. Symptoms usually go away when the dose of the treatment is lowered or when treatment is stopped. The skin begins to heal after a few weeks.</p>

<h3>What To Do</h3>

<p>Tell your doctor or nurse as soon as you begin to have any of these changes. Do not stop taking your medicines unless your doctor or nurse tells you to. Follow these suggestions to help you manage:</p>

<ul>
<li>During the first month, stay out of the sun or use a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. It should protect you against both UVB and UVA sunlight.</li>
<li>If you are taking erlotinib (Tarceva), always take the pill on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating).</li>
<li>Makeup is safe to use, but avoid those with many ingredients and stop using them if they result in redness and itching.</li>
</ul>
