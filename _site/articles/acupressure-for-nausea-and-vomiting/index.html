<p><strong>Summary: </strong>Description of accupressure - finding pressure point p-6, massaging. Contact details for integrative medicine at MSK.</p> 


</div>
<p>Acupressure is an ancient healing art. It is based on the Traditional Chinese Medicine concept of acupuncture. Acupressure uses finger pressure to stimulate trigger points on the body (acupoints). Pressing these points can help release muscle tension,and promote blood circulation. Clinical research suggests it can also relieve many common chemotherapy side effects. Acupressure is simple to learn and can be taught to and used by anyone.</p>

<p>P-6 or Neiguan is a pressure point on the inner arm. It has been used to relieve nausea and vomiting related to chemotherapy.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Rotate your forearm to have your palm face up. The point is located two inches below the wrist crease. If you place your first three fingers across your wrist, the point is usually directly below them (Fig 1). Once you find it, place your thumb on the point (Fig 2). You should be able to feel one or two large tendons under your thumb. Apply pressure in a circular motion to this point with your thumb for two to three minutes. The pressure should be firm but not cause discomfort. After two or three minutes, apply pressure to the same point on the other wrist.</p>

<p>Use this pressure point several times a day or as needed. We recommend using it before each meal and at bedtime.</p>
