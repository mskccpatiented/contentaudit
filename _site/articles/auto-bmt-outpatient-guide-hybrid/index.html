<p class="question hidden"><span class="complete">Some of the topics align neatly to phases, some don't. Should we summarize the most important information about topic, then refer to a more complete version in the appendix? That would be my recommendation. Say for example we are in Phase 2, could we summarize issues related to fertility, then refer the person to a longer guide at the back of our guide?)</span> Decision: Yes, summarize and refer to complete guides.</p>


<h2>Welcome, Overview</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Outpatient Autologous Stem Cell Transplant program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.</p>

<h3>What's in This Guide</h3>

<p>This guide will help you learn about autologous transplantation; what it is and why it's been recommended for you. The guide will become an important part of your transplant journey and will add to the verbal information you receive from doctors, nurses, social workers and other members of your healthcare team.</p>

<p>The information in this guide will help you prepare for your transplant; you'll learn about the key phases of your treatment and the team who will care for you. We will help you prepare for each phase. We will recommend things you should do and things you should avoid.</p>

<p>We will also recommend further reading on useful topics like sexual activity, diet and exercise.</p>

<h3>How To Use This Guide</h3>

<p>You should read this guide completely at least once including any additional resources included at the back of the guide - then refer to the guide as your treatment progresses.</p>

<p>As you read through the guide make a note of any questions that come to mind. A member of your healthcare team will answer your questions when you see them next.</p>

<h3>Language Used In This Guide</h3>

<p>We've done our best to keep the amount of medical terms in this guide to a minimum, however there are some words that we need you to understand so that you can participate fully in your treatment. With this in mind, we've prepared a glossary of useful terms at the back of this guide.</p>

<h3>We Need Your Help</h3>

<p>We are always improving the information we provide to patients and their families/friends. If you get to the end of this guide and can think of ways it could be improved (maybe there's something that was missing, or wasn't completely clear), please e-mail us at patiented@mskcc.org and we'll incorporate your feedback into the next version.</p>

<h2>Bone Marrow Basics</h2>

<h3>What is Bone Marrow, What Are Stem Cells?</h3>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder:Diagram of the process by which stem cells become blood; marrow->stem cells->differentiated cells. The stock ones available online are not good and we can do better.</p></div>


<p>Bone marrow is a substance found in the spaces in the center of the larger bones in your body; your hip, breastbone and pelvis.</p>

<p>Your bone marrow is where the different types of blood cells are made - including the white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that carry oxygen and and platelets that clot to stop you from bleeding.</p>

<p>But, you might ask, how are these blood cells "made"?</p>

<p>Stem cells are immature cells that produce the blood cells in the body. These cells are found in the bone marrow and some also circulate in your blood.</p>

<p>Stem cells can create many copies of themselves - <strong>dividing</strong> again and again to create more stem cells. They can also follow a path called <strong>differentiation</strong>, where they change into the different types of blood cells found in your body. Any stem cell can become a specific kind of blood cell such as a red blood cell, white blood cell or platelet.</p>

<p>Stem cells are constantly dividing and differentiating in our bone marrow creating new blood cells to replace older cells.</p>

<p><strong>Check: (Re-word) You will hear your transplant referred to as a "stem cell transplant" or "bone marrow transplant". The important thing to remember is that all transplants are technically stem cell transplants wince it is immature blood cells that are used. The stem cells may be tank from either the bone marrow or circulating blood.</strong></p>

<h3>Why You Need a Transplant</h3>

<p>An autologous stem cell transplant is being recommended for you because, while you have cancer, you are in relatively good health and your doctors feel that a transplant is the best treatment for your specific disease.</p>

<p>Cancer cells can be killed using chemotherapy. The dose of chemotherapy that you will receive are very high, and will destroy most of the blood cells in your bone marrow and bloodstream.</p>

<p>Your stem cells are colleges and frozen before you receive chemotherapy. Collecting your stem cells beforehand allows us give you a high dose of chemotherapy before returning your stem cells to you. Once your stem cells have been given back to you they will slowly start to make new immune and blood cells.</p>

<div class="outstanding invisible remove">
One drawback of chemotherapy is that it also kills other types of rapidly dividing cells in your body - including the stem cells that produce your blood.

<p class="invisible remove">Because you can't make new blood cells, your immune system and your body's ability to renew itself are compromised.</p>

This is why you need a transplant.
</div>


<h3>Autologous Stem Cell Transplant</h3>

<p>Autologous means "from yourself". When you have an autologous stem cell transplant (sometimes called an autologous bone marrow transplant, though stem cell transplant is a more accurate term) your stem cells are harvested from your body before you receive your high-dose chemotherapy.</p>

<p class="note invisible">This might be a good place to introduce the "we can give you higher doses of chemotherapy" paragraph.</p>


<p>These stem cells are stored safely while you receive your chemotherapy, then given back to you. You are literally receiving a transplant from yourself.</p>

<p>An autologous transplant has three key phases:</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of the process of harvesting/collection. Apheresis. </p></div>


<p><strong>Before</strong> - You will prepare for your stem cell transplant. A central venous catheter will be inserted into your upper chest wall. You will receive drugs that stimulate your body to make more stem cells than normal. Your stem cells will be harvested from your body and stored. You will receive your chemotherapy, called the "conditioning regimen", to kill the cancer cells. Your stem cells will also be killed and you will lose your ability to make new blood cells.</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of chemotherapy being given through the catheter. </p></div>


<p><strong>During</strong> - You have lost your ability to make new blood cells so your immune system is severely compromised. Your stem cells are taken from storage and infused into your body through your catheter. This is your transplant.</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of the process of engraftment. </p></div>


<p><strong>After</strong> - The infused stem cells find their way through your bloodstream to your bones. Over time they take hold in your bones, a process called "engraftment". They begin to divide and create healthy, new blood cells. Your immune and vital systems begin to return.</p>

<h3>Outpatient Autologous Stem Cell Transplant</h3>

<p>Until relatively recently stem cell transplants were always done in the hospital. Patients would live in the hospital while undergoing treatment, and would remain in the hospital for a period of their recovery.</p>

<p>**Check: (Incorporate, ask about overlap with other text) Depending on your condition and treatment plan you may receive part of your care in the hospital or in the outpatient BMT clinic. During the phase of treatment while you are cared for in the outpatient setting you will stay in a local hotel or apartment)</p>

<p>Now, stem cell transplants like yours can be done out of the hospital - called an "outpatient transplant". This means that while you are receiving your treatment, you will stay in a local hotel or apartment. Every day you will come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic for blood work, vital signs, weight and physical examination. You will only be admitted to the hospital if you develop complications.</p>

<p>Here is a typical timeline for someone having an outpatient transplant:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Day −4:</em> You and your caregiver will check into a hotel or apartment close to MSKCC's main campus in Manhattan.</li>
<li><em>Day −3:</em> You and your caregiver will come to MSKCC's Interventional Radiology department at main campus where a central venous catheter is inserted in your upper chest wall. You return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.</li>
<li><em>Day −2:</em> You will come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic where you receive your chemotherapy. You will return to your hotel or apartment in the evening. (Note that, in some cases, patients can require multiple days of chemotherapy) that the number of days you will receive chemotherapy varies. Other patients will require multiple days.</li>
<li><em>Day −1:</em> This is a rest day; you will remain in your hotel or apartment for the day.</li>
<li><em>Day 0:</em> Transplant day. You will come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic where you receive your stem cell transplant. You will return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.</li>
<li><em>Day +1 to +12:</em> You will visit the Outpatient BMT Clinic every day to have blood work done, your vital signs checked and a physical examination. You'll also receive hydration, electrolytes and transfusions if necessary. You return to your hotel or apartment every evening.</li>
</ul>


<p>After <em>Day +12</em> your central venous catheter will be removed. If you live within one hour of MSKCC's main campus you can return home. If you live further away you will stay at your local hotel or apartment for a few more weeks. You will still visit the Outpatient BMT Clinic regularly.</p>

<p>You'll see that the days leading up to your transplant are given minus number; Day −3, Day −2 etc. The day of your transplant is Day 0, and the days that follow are Day +1, Day +2 etc. Your healthcare team will use this format when they explain your transplant to you.</p>

<p class="move invisible">Move: While you are in the outpatient clinic you will be cared for in a private room that has a bed and bathroom. A light breakfast and lunch will be provided for you. There is a communal lounge with coffee and tea for caregivers.</p>


<h2>Your Transplant Team</h2>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Photograph of the outpatient transplant team would work, if printing is not an issue.</p></div>


<p>A team of healthcare professionals from the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service will care for you through all phases of your treatment. Below you'll find a list of the team members and their roles. You will meet each member of your healthcare team at different times during your treatment.</p>

<p>Your <strong>attending doctor</strong> will be in charge of your care throughout your treatment. Even though one specific doctor will be your primary doctor, you will be cared for by different doctors during your transplant.</p>

<div class="remove invisible">**Check if this still works:Fellows, nurse practitioners, hospitalists and house staff are also partners in your care.**</div>


<p>A <strong>fellow</strong> is a doctor who has completed general training and is receiving additional training in cancer care.</p>

<p>A <strong>nurse practitioner (NP)</strong> is a nurse who has a master's or doctoral degree. The nurse practitioner is licensed to examine you, provide medical treatments and prescribe medications. The NPs will be responsible for your daily care when you come to the Outpatient Clinic.</p>

<p>Your <strong>BMT Nurse Coordinator</strong> will communicate and work with you and your team of doctors to organize all the testing, procedures and consults with other professionals required prior to your transplant. This nurse will also provide you with treatment calendars describing the timeline for your plan of care and education about the pre-transplant process.</p>

<p>A team of <strong>nurses</strong> will provide your day-to-day nursing care. They are registered nurses specially trained in the care of transplant patients.</p>

<p>The <strong>hospitalist</strong> is a doctor who only sees patients while they are in the hospital. At MSKCC a hospitalist is on duty all night.</p>

<p><strong>House staff</strong> are doctors who are completing their residency. They work under the supervision of the fellows and attending doctors.</p>

<p>A <strong>Clinical Pharmacist</strong> who specializes in the care of transplant patients will review your medications with you and your caregiver, teaching you how to take them properly and to inform you of any side effects they may cause. The pharmacist will review your medications frequently with the outpatient team.</p>

<p><strong>Social Workers</strong> are members will help you, your family and those around you manage the stress that comes with the transplant process. The social workers understand the issues faced by transplant patients and are on hand to listen, offer counseling, and refer you or your family to other resources and services as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Counselors</strong> from Patient Financial Services will work with you and your insurance company to determine your transplant benefits. These financial counselors are experienced in the insurance issues faced by transplant patients. Each insurance company and their policies differ, so when your insurance company requires authorization your financial counselor will assist with that process.</p>

<h3>Meeting Your Team</h3>

<p>When does it happen: Around Day −30.</p>

<p class="outstanding">To be written</p>


<h3>Choosing Your Caregiver</h3>

<p>One of the most important steps as you prepare for your transplant is choosing your caregiver. This person is usually a family member or a close friend and will be an important part of your healthcare team. Your caregiver will be responsible for a lot of the day to day medical, practical, emotional support you need during your outpatient transplant.</p>

<p>Your caregiver will receive specific instructions from the healthcare team about their responsibilities. Some of these responsibilities include:</p>

<h4>Medical Support</h4>

<ul>
<li>Gathering information from the healthcare team</li>
<li>Caring for your catheter</li>
<li>Making sure you take your medications and keeping a written record of when you take your medications</li>
<li>Taking your temperature every 4 hours while you are awake and keeping a written record of your temperature</li>
<li>Keeping a written record of how much fluid you drink every day</li>
<li>Noticing any changes in your condition</li>
<li>Telling your healthcare team about any new symptoms you may have or changes in your condition</li>
<li>Calling for medical help in an emergency</li>
</ul>


<h4>Practical Support</h4>

<ul>
<li>Dealing with financial and insurance issues</li>
<li>Preparing your meals according to a low-microbial diet</li>
<li>Bring you to and from the hospital</li>
<li>Maintaining a clean environment in your hotel, apartment or house</li>
<li>Keeping family members and friends up to date about your condition</li>
<li>Managing the number of visitors you have and keeping you away from anyone who is sick</li>
</ul>


<h4>Emotional Support</h4>

<ul>
<li>Paying attention to your moods and feelings</li>
<li>Communicating with you, listening to you</li>
<li>Understanding your needs and your decisions</li>
</ul>


<p class="question invisible"><span class="complete">I would like to write this bullet-point list into more fluid text, is that acceptable?</span> Decision: Yes, re-write.</p>


<h4>Choosing the Right Caregiver</h4>

<p>Being a caregiver is a full-time, 24/7 responsibility and can be tiring, demanding and stressful - especially if your condition, schedule or treatment changes.</p>

<p>While you're undergoing your transplant your caregiver will not be able to work and will need to stay with you for most of the day and night (though while you are in the Outpatient BMT clinic your caregiver can take some time for themselves; this is something we strongly recommend).</p>

<p>It is important for your caregiver to maintain a positive attitude, calm demeanor and flexible approach - and to provide you with encouragement. It's important for you to understand that the caregiver role is challenging and that your caregiver might find themselves stressed by the responsibilities.</p>

<p>Take time now to think about who you would like to be your caregiver. It should be somebody you trust who can take the time to care for you. Your caregiver should be someone who can offer you the practical and emotional support you need.</p>

<h4>Multiple Caregivers</h4>

<p>If there isn't one person who can act as your caregiver then it may be possible for you to have different caregivers scheduled during different times. It is best to limit the number of caregivers to 1 or 2 individuals.</p>

<p class="question">Is there anything more we need to say about this?</p>


<h4>Resources for Caregivers</h4>

<p>Talk to your healthcare team about choosing a caregiver. We have included useful resources for caregivers at the back of this guide.</p>

<div class="outstanding invisible">
### BMT Orientation
To be written. I don't understand how the BMT Orientation works; research and write content. Does the face-to-face BMT orientation still happen?</div>


<h3>Financial Clearance</h3>

<h4>Insurance</h4>

<p class="outstanding">Summarize insurance issues, what the patient needs to do to get clearance. The role of Patient Financial Services. </p>


<h4>Financial Support</h4>

<p class="outstanding">Sources of financial assistance available to patients. What these grants cover, what they don't cover. How to apply. Social work team are going to offer relevant content. </p>


<h3>Pre-Transplant Medical Evaluation</h3>

<p class="feedback remove invisible">Before you receive your chemotherapy or undergo your transplant you will have some tests that will give us a good understanding of your baseline health and organ function.</p>


<p> To prepare for transplant you will need to make several trips to MSKCC. Before you become a transplant candidate your overall physical condition needs to be evaluated. We often refer to this as the "work-up" or "restaging" period. During the work-up you will need to have some or all of the following tests done to give us a good understanding of your baseline health and organ function:</p>

<ul>
<li>A chest x-ray - done to ensure your lungs are clear and there is no evidence of a pneumonia or other problems</li>
<li>Blood tests - done to evaluate your baseline kidney and liver function, and to assess your white blood cell, hemoglobin and platelet counts. Your past exposure to certain viruses is also checked.</li>
<li>Urine tests</li>
<li>Electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (ECHO) or other tests that give information about your heart</li>
<li>Pulmonary function tests (PFT's) - breathing tests that measure lung function</li>
<li>Computerized axial tomography (CT) Scan - an x-ray that provides cross-sectional views and images of soft tissue as well as bone. Some scans use contrast dye that you drink or have injected into your body. Please alert your doctor if you have a known allergy to contrast dye, or seafood or iodine. If you have an allergy you may need to be given steroids to prevent a reaction the dye before your scan.</li>
<li>Dental Exam - You must have a full dental exam. Any cavities, loose fillings or gum disease should be taken care of before your transplant. You can have these done by your own dentist or you can see our dentist. If you see your own dentist please ask them to provide a note saying that you have no dental problems. If there are issues please ask the dentist to contact MSKCC dentist.</li>
<li>Positron emission tomography (PET) Scan – a scan used to visualize physiologic function in body areas</li>
<li>Bone marrow Aspiration and Biopsy - A bone marrow aspirate is a small sample of bone marrow usually taken from the back of your hip. Your hip will be numbed and a needle will be inserted into the bone marrow and a small amount of bone marrow liquid will be withdrawn. A bone marrow biopsy will be performed at the same time as your bone marrow aspiration. The biopsy involves collecting a tiny piece of bone for examination. This procedure is done to evaluate how well your bone marrow is producing cells and to check for any sign of cancer in the marrow.</li>
<li>Skeletal survey - An x-ray of the major bones in your body done to check for any signs of disease. This can take a few hours to complete.</li>
</ul>


<p>These tests are usually done in the 30 days before your transplant (Day −30 onwards), but sometimes the pre-transplant evaluation can take longer. The BMT Nurse Coordinator will work with you and your caregiver to schedule the tests.</p>

<p>The results of the tests will be used to plan your treatment and adjust it to your specific needs and to make sure that it is safe to start your treatment.</p>

<p>Your doctor and nurse will explain any other tests that you may need.</p>

<p class="question hidden"><span class="complete">When are these tests done, how are they scheduled? Also, is this list of tests accurate/complete? What about liver function test, biopsies etc.? Also, can we be any more specific about "blood tests" - what sort of blood tests? What is the purpose of the chest x-ray? I'd like to get more detailed, granular with this - this is our one shot to explain their testing.</span> Answer: These tests are part of the pre-transplant evaluation and are scheduled by the BMT Nurse Coordinator. They are done within 30 days prior to the transplant (to get a more complete picture of the patients baseline health and organ function prior to clearing to start high dose chemotherapy). The blood tests are done to evaluate baseline kidney, liver and hematological function (white blood cell, hemoglobin and platelet counts). A baseline chest X-ray is done to ensure the patient has "clear lungs" and no evidence of a pneumonia or other abnormalities.</p>


<h3>Childcare</h3>

<div class="outstanding">To be written</div>


<h3>Making Arrangements for Your Pets</h3>

<p class="outstanding">Reconcile with "Contact with animals, including your pets - they cannot stay with you during your transplant" in living with Neutropenia.</p>


<p>Animals can carry diseases and may present risks to you while your immune system is compromised. Although most people consider their pets a part of the family, there are a few precautions that need to be observed:
* During your transplant period (chemotherapy through count recovery) you should minimize direct contact with animals.
* Do not allow your pets to sleep with you. Don’t allow your pets to lick you in the face.
* Protect yourself from bites or scratches.<em> Be sure that your pet is up-to-date with immunizations and any booster shots.</em> Have your veterinarian check your pet’s stool yearly for parasites.<em> Have your pet treated for fleas. If your pet walks through wooded areas have it screened for ticks.</em> Do not clean cat litter boxes or clean up after your dog in the street. Have someone else do these things for you. * Avoid contact with birds, lizards, snakes, turtles, iguanas, exotic pets, hamsters or other rodents while you recover. Contact with birds or reptiles waste may expose you to certain infectious agents.After you have recovered from your transplant you will be provided additional instructions regarding pet care in the "Returning Home After Your Autologous Transplant" guide.### Moving into a Nearby Apartment or Hotel
For the duration of your treatment you and your caregiver will stay at a hotel or apartment within walking distance of the Outpatient BMT Clinic at MSKCC's main hospital. You and your caregiver will make regular visits to the Outpatient BMT Clinic.
The arrangements for your lodgings will be made and communicated to you by your BMT nurse coordinator.</p>

<h3>Having Your Central Venous Catheter Inserted</h3>

<p>On or before Day −4 you and your caregiver will come to MSKCC's Interventional Radiology department at main campus to have a central venous catheter inserted into the wall of your chest.</p>

<h4>What is a Central Venous Catheter? Why Do I Need One?</h4>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: A clear diagram of the central venous catheter.</p></div>


<p>A central venous catheter is a tube inserted into a large vein near your collarbone. On the outside of your body the catheter divides into 2 or 3 smaller tubes called "lumens".</p>

<p>A central venous catheter allows your healthcare team to give you medicine, fluids, electrolytes, blood transfusions and chemotherapy without the need to stick you repeatedly with a needle. Having a catheter will make your treatment much more comfortable.</p>

<p>The catheter will stay in your body throughout your treatment and is usually removed around twelve days after you receive your stem cell transplant.</p>

<h4>Before Your Catheter is Inserted</h4>

<p>Before your catheter is inserted you shouldn't take aspirin, any products that contain aspirin, or vitamin E. You should also tell your doctor if you are taking any blood thinners or any medication for diabetes.</p>

<p class="question invisible">Do we need to state this or is the BMT Outpatient Team monitoring/communicating this?</p>


<p></p>

<p>Call your doctor before your procedure if you develop any illness. This includes a fever, cold, flu, or sore throat.</p>

<p>If you have been told to be on a clear liquid diet you shouldn't eat any solid food after midnight the night before your procedure and you should continue to drink clear liquids up to 2 hours before you arrive at the hospital for your procedure.</p>

<h4>The Day Your Catheter is Inserted</h4>

<p>Your transplant coordinator will work with you to schedule the insertion of your catheter; it's likely that you'll be asked to report to the Surgical Day Hospital, where the catheter will be inserted, several hours before the procedure takes place. This will allow the medical team to evaluate you and make sure everything is in order before they insert the catheter.</p>

<p>You will probably already be staying in a nearby hotel or apartment. On the morning of the procedure you may shower, but you shouldn't apply any creams or lotions to your body. Take any medications you've been instructed to take.</p>

<p>If you wear contact lenses you should wear glasses on the day your catheter is inserted. If you don't own glasses then bring a container for your contact lenses to the hospital with you.</p>

<p>You and your caregiver should leave all valuables, including jewelry, at home. Bring only your medications and the money you need for the day to the hospital.</p>

<p>Enter the hospital through the main entrance at 1275 York Avenue. Take the M elevators at the top of the escalator to the 2<span class="superscript">nd</span> floor. As you step off the elevator, enter the double doors to the Surgical Day Hospital. Check in at the desk. Please arrive on time.</p>

<p>In the SDH, you will change into a gown, robe, and slippers. When you are ready, you will be taken to Interventional Radiology.</p>

<h4>The Procedure</h4>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: A diagram or image showing the incision and placement of the catheter. The text is quite intimidating, so it'd be good to show the procedure in reasonable detail to allay fears.</p></div>


<p>The placement of the catheter should take about 30 minutes. First, an IV line will be started and you will be given medication through your IV line to make you sleepy. Your blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and oxygen levels will be monitored during your procedure.</p>

<p>Two areas of your body will be numbed with a local anesthetic. A small incision (surgical cut) will be made near your collarbone, usually at the base of your neck. This incision will be used to gain access to the vein where the catheter will be placed.</p>

<p>A second incision will be made on your chest, under your collarbone. The catheter will be inserted through this small incision and tunneled under your skin to the first incision. The catheter will then be threaded into the vein. You may feel a pulling sensation.</p>

<p>A cuff surrounds part of the catheter that lies in the tunnel. This cuff will become anchored in the tunnel about 3 to 4 weeks after your procedure. It prevents bacteria from entering the tunnel and traveling up to your vein. This decreases your risk of infection and prevents your catheter from falling out.</p>

<p>The incision near your collarbone will be stitched closed. The stitches will be absorbed and will not need to be removed. The outside of your incision will be covered with strips of adhesive tape. Your catheter will be stitched to your skin at the point where it exits your body so that it will stay in position. You will be able to see this thread around your catheter.</p>

<p class="question invisible">How long does the procedure take, does the patient need to recuperate at the SDH afterwards or do they go straight home? Useful to put a sense of time around the procedure.</p>




<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: A diagram or photograph of the catheter in place. </p></div>




<p class="question hidden">Is the person given supplies to take care of their catheter?</p>


<h3>After Your Catheter Has Been Inserted</h3>

<p>After your catheter has been inserted you will be monitored in the Surgical Day Hospital for 2-3 hours before being allowed to return to your hotel or apartment.</p>

<p class="question hidden">I assume that once the catheter has finished the person goes back to their apartment/hotel? Our story needs to travel home with them.</p>


<p><strong>Check: You will need to leave the dressings covering the incision near your collarbone in place and dry for 48 hours. You can remove these dressings after two days and can leave the site of the incision open to the air. The strips of adhesive tape that cover the incision should be left in place until they start to peel off. This should happen about 3 to 5 days after your catheter is inserted.</strong></p>

<p class="question invisible">If the patient gets their catheter on Day-4 and it takes 3-5 days to heal, and weeks to completely anchor in place, doesn't this run into their chemotherapy and transplant (and beyond)? The text in the CVC guide doesn't address this (obviously, as it's a generic guide). Thoughts?</p>


<p>The point where the catheter exits your skin will still need to be covered with a dressing. The stitch at this site keeps your catheter in place until the cuff becomes fully anchored.</p>

<p>If you have discomfort at your incision sites or around the cuff ask your nurse for medication to relieve your pain.</p>

<h4>Taking Care of Your Catheter</h4>

<p>Taking good care of your catheter is important. You are responsible for caring for your catheter when you are away from the hospital or clinic. While you are undergoing your outpatient stem cell transplant the nurse will change your catheter dressing, change the caps on the lumens and flush your catheter during your daily clinic visits.</p>

<p>A nurse will teach you how to care for your catheter. You will learn how to change your dressing while ensuring that it remains free from germs; this is known as "sterile technique". Using sterile technique will minimize your risk for infection. Your caregiver will learn how to change your dressing with you.</p>

<p>To take care of your catheter one of your nurses will give you supplies including clean dressings, gauze pads, lumen caps, tape, clamps and other essentials.</p>

<p class="question invisible">When will a nurse teach you? Which nurse? Where does this happen?</p>


<p>Your catheter should not interfere with your day to day activities as you get ready for your transplant, but you should avoid strenuous activities and contact sports.</p>

<p>Prepare the following emergency kit and keep it with you at all times:</p>

<p class="question invisible">Where do we introduce the caps, clamps - this is the first time they're mentioned. What do they do in the case of an emergency? (This is covered in the full guide)</p>


<ul>
<li>Two catheter caps</li>
<li>One toothless clamp</li>
<li>Alcohol swabs</li>
<li>One roll of 2-inch tape</li>
<li>Two 2 &times; 2 gauze pads</li>
<li>Your doctor's office and emergency telephone numbers.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is a summary of the things you'll do on to take care of your catheter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change the Tegaderm<span class="superscript">&trade;</span> dressing once a week</li>
<li>Change the caps on the lumens and flush the catheter twice a week</li>
<li>Use the small white clamps on each lumen of the catheter to clamp the catheter closed when it is not in use.</li>
<li>Use a waterproof cover, called an Aquaquard<span class="superscript">&trade;</span>, over your catheter when showering or bathing</li>
<li>Avoid submerging the catheter in water (e.g. in a swimming pool)</li>
<li>Keep your catheter secure, avoid pulling it or the lumens.</li>
<li>Tape the lumens to your skin, pin them to your clothing, or tape them to your bra if you're a woman.</li>
</ul>


<p class="question invisible">What does this mean: Clamp the catheter when it's not in use</p>


<h4>Problems with your Catheter</h4>

<p>You and your caregiver should be on the look-out for any problems with your catheter. Infection is the most serious complication to watch out for. Look at the catheter site daily. Notify your doctor, NP or nurse if you experience any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Redness, swelling and/or drainage (a liquid that can vary in color but may be clear, bloody or green/yellowish) at the exit site.</li>
<li>Pain or tenderness at the exit site</li>
<li>Temperature greater than 100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C.</li>
<li>Flu-like symptoms or chills</li>
</ul>


<p class="feedback remove hidden">If you notice a discharge from your catheter (a liquid that can vary in color but which is likely to be clear, bloody or yellow/green) or if the exit site around the catheter is red, raw, or swollen, call your doctor. These may be signs of infection.</p>




<p class="question invisible">What does "has drainage" mean?</p>


<p>Other complications may be related to the catheter itself. Notify your doctor, NP or nurse if you experience any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>You see a hole or break in the catheter</li>
<li>Swelling in your face, neck or arm on the same side of your body as the catheter</li>
</ul>


<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Clamping the catheter above a leak.</p></div>


<p>If your catheter is leaking at any time, clamp it above the leak. Use the white catheter clamp on the catheter, if possible. Wipe the area that is leaking with an alcohol pad and then cover the leak with tape. Follow the instructions in your BMT Emergency Guide (included at the back of this guide); if it is between 8am and 8pm call the BMT Outpatient Clinic. If it is after 8pm call your attending physician or go directly to the urgent care center.</p>

<p class="question invisible">Who specifically do they call? Call the BMT Outpatient clinic?</p>




<p class="question invisible">I edited "Cover the site with tape" rolling it into the sentence "Wipe the area that is leaking with an alcohol pad and then cover the leak with tape". The word "site" felt ambiguous and my assumption is that we're taking about putting tape over the leak.</p>


<p>Full instructions on how to care for your catheter are included in <strong>Caring for Your Central Venous Catheter</strong> which is included at the end of this guide. You should read it in full and refer to it when you are changing your dressing or caring for your catheter.</p>

<h3>Mobilization and Harvesting</h3>

<p>In an autologous transplant your stem cells are first mobilized and then harvested (also called "collected") from your body before you receive chemotherapy. They are infused into your body after your chemotherapy; this is your stem cell transplant.</p>

<p class="feedback remove invisible">On or around Day −4 you will be given an injection of a drug that "mobilizes" your stem cells, then those stem cells will be collected or "harvested" from your bloodstream.</p>


<p>Mobilization is the process of increasing the number of stem cells produced by your bone marrow and released into your bloodstream.</p>

<p>Stem cell harvesting, or collecting, is the process of separating whole blood into its major components (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma) then removing stem cells from the white blood cell component.</p>

<h4>Mobilization</h4>

<p>Normally your stem cells live in your bone marrow (although a few circulate in your bloodstream) where they are difficult to access and collect for transplantation.</p>

<p>To increase the amount of stem cells in your bloodstream you'll be given injections of a drug called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF). GCSF stimulates your body to make more stem cells than usual and encourages them to move into your bloodstream where they can be collected much more easily. This process is called <em>mobilization</em>. GCSF drugs include filgrastim (Neupogen<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>), pegfilgrastim (Neulasta<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>) and plerixafor (Mozobil<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>).</p>

<p>In most cases GCSF injections are self-administered, that is you will inject yourself with the drug while at home. You will be given the GCSF in pre-filled syringes, which you'll keep in your refrigerator. Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will create a personal <em>Mobilization Calendar</em> for you which will tell you when to give yourself the injections. The number of injections needed will depend on a number of factors, including your weight.</p>

<p>A full guide to giving yourself GCSF injections is covered in the document "Directions for Giving an Injection Below the Skin with Neupogen (Filgrastim) or Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) in a Pre-Filled Syringe" which is included at the back of this guide. Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will talk you through this information as well.</p>

<p>Some patients will not give themselves injections of Neupogen or Neulasta (both types of GCSF), and will instead be given a different type of GCSF called Mozobil. If Mozobil is recommended for you then the injections will be given by a nurse in the BMT clinic.</p>

<p class="question invisible">How many injections, when are the GCSF injections given, by whom, where etc.</p>


<h4>Harvesting of your Stem Cells</h4>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: The harvesting/collection process. Patient connected to apheresis machine.</p></div>


<p>The injections of GCSF into your body will stimulate the growth and mobilization of your stem cells, then they will be harvested. Harvesting is the procedure used to collect some of these stem cells in your blood.</p>

<p><strong>Check: (Location) Prior to being scheduled for stem cell harvesting a nurse or doctor will examine your veins to see if they are okay for the procedure. If your veins are not healthy enough a temporary catheter will be inserted into a vein in your chest. The catheter will remain in place for several weeks or months. You will be given an appointment to have the catheter inserted. Your nurse will give you a booklet that describes the procedure and how to care for the catheter afterwards.</strong></p>

<p class="question">Is this the same procedure as the fitting of your catheter? Does having unhealthy/inadequate veins in your arm prompt the fitting of your catheter? (Define "temporary")</p>


<p><span class="invisible"><strong>Check: The harvesting procedure is done in the Blood Donor Room</strong>.</span> Your BMT Nurse Coordinator or your doctor will schedule 3-5 harvesting sessions to collect enough cells. The exact number of sessions is determined by the number of stem cells that are collected in each session. You will be notified each day if you need to return for another harvesting session. Each session will last three to four hours.</p>

<p>You should eat dairy products or other foods that are rich in calcium the night before and the morning of your appointment. Wear comfortable clothes.</p>

<p>Harvesting will take place at our Blood Donor Room. You will lie in a bed or sit in a reclining chair. <span class="feedback remove invisible">A nurse will examine your arms to see if your veins in your arm are in good condition. If they are then the nurse will insert an IV line into your vein and a machine that separates the stem cells from your blood will be connected to your IV line.</p>

<p>If your catheter has already been inserted then it might be used for harvesting instead of an IV line. In this case one of the lumens of your catheter will be connected to the machine that separates the stem cells from your blood. </span></p>

<p>You will be connected to a machine by IV tubes connected to your veins in your arms or your catheter. Blood will be withdrawn through the IV line or catheter and circulated through the machine where your stem cells will be collected. The rest of your blood is returned to you.</p>

<p>If you wish, you will be able to watch TV or read. A family member or friend may sit with you during the procedure started. Since patients sometimes complain of feeling cold during the procedure, blankets will be available.</p>

<p>After your harvesting procedure is done, your catheter will be flushed and recapped. If the veins in your arms were used for the harvesting, a dressing will be applied to prevent bleeding. It should remain in place for at least three hours, but not more than five hours.</p>

<p>Your stem cells will be brought to our stem cell laboratory where they'll be frozen and and stored safely until your transplant day.</p>

<p>After harvesting most patients have minimal side effects and can resume their regular activities. The most common side effects are numbness or tingling in the lips, hands or feet. This is caused by a temporary decrease in the calcium levels in your blood during the harvesting.</p>

<p>Call Your Doctor If You:</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop a fever (100.4° F or 38° C) or chills.</li>
<li>Notice any redness, bleeding, drainage, or pain at the catheter or needle insertion site.</li>
<li>Notice any bleeding or bruising</li>
<li>Notice numbness or tingling of your lips, hands or feed.</li>
</ul>


<p class="question invisible">Where does mobilization/harvesting happen, when etc? I want to put this in the context of the Outpatient BMT process and give clear instructions.</p>




<p class="outstanding">Move conditioning regimen to phase 2.</p>


<h3>Conditioning Regimen</h3>

<div class="feedback remove invisible">
### Receiving Your Chemotherapy

* When does it happen: Day −2.

Two days before your transplant you'll receive your chemotherapy. (This process is also called "conditioning" because it conditions, or prepares, your body for transplant). Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will work with you to schedule and explain your day of chemotherapy. 

You'll be treated with a chemotherapy drug called Melphalan. Information about Melphalan, including its side effects, is included at the back of this guide.

This will be a busy day. Not only will you receive your chemotherapy, but you'll also meet your Clinical Pharmacist who will review your medications with you and show you how to use your pill box. You and your caregiver will also be given a lot of information about the rest of your treatment and what to expect - some of this information will be on paper and some of it will be verbal. Your caregiver might like to bring a notebook and pen to the clinic to note down key points and any questions.
</div>


<p>Conditioning regimen is another name for the high dose chemotherapy that you will receive prior to the transplant. The specific regimen you receive will depend upon your disease, previous treatments and your specific transplant protocol or treatment plan.</p>

<p>The conditioning regimen starts on a "negative numbered" day. If you are receiving one single dose of chemotherapy your chemotherapy will start on day -2. Depending on your treatment plan you may have one or multiple days of chemotherapy. Your stem cell transplant always takes place on Day 0. Remember that every day after transplant is referred to as a positive numbered day (e.g. +1, +2 etc).</p>

<p>Your physician and BMT Nurse Coordinator will discuss your treatment plan with you.</p>

<p>Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will work with you to plan your schedule and will provide you with a treatment calendar. The BMT Nurse Coordinator will tell you the date, time and location of your treatment.</p>

<h4>The Morning before Chemotherapy</h4>

<div class="feedback remove invisible">
#### Outpatient BMT Clinic
</div>


<p>On the first day of your treatment you and your caregiver should come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic at MSKCC's main campus at 8am. You should wear comfortable, loose everyday clothes - loose fitting tops or shirts that open to the front (so that we can access your catheter), comfortable pants (sweat pants or track suit). You can expect to be in the BMT Clinic for 6 to 10 hours, so you might want to bring newspapers, books, a laptop or tablet computer - things to pass the time.</p>

<p>Once you arrive at the BMT Outpatient Clinic you will be brought to your own private room. A nurse practitioner will review your medical history and ask you a set of questions about how you're feeling. Your vital signs will be checked and you will be weighed.</p>

<p>Once you have been fully evaluated you will meet with the Clinical Pharmacist. The Pharmacist will explain the medications you will take throughout your treatment. You will be provided with all the medications needed. You will be given a medication list to follow.</p>

<p>Some of your medications will be "self-administered" in that you and your caregiver will manage them. You'll take your self-administered medications on a regular schedule or as needed. The Pharmacist will give you a a medication box (also called a pill box) that you'll use to store and manage your self-administered medications. The pharmacist will explain how to use and refill the pill box.</p>

<p>Since you will be at the outpatient BMT clinic for several hours daily you will be provided with meals.</p>

<p class="question hidden">Could you walk me through what happens here in detail? They arrive, who do they meet, where do they go etc.</p>


<h4>Receiving Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>Once you have been evaluated and the Pharmacist has talked through your medications<span class="feedback remove invisible">, you'll be brought to a nearby chemotherapy suite where</span> you'll receive your chemotherapy.<span class="feedback remove invisible">You are free to bring newspapers, books, your tablet or computer with you.</span></p>

<p>Before you receive your chemotherapy it goes through a number of safety checks to make sure everything is correct.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your chemotherapy is ordered by your doctor</li>
<li>A nurse checks your chemotherapy order</li>
<li>A pharmacist checks your chemotherapy order</li>
<li>A pharmacist checks your blood test results</li>
<li>Your chemotherapy is prepared in the Pharmacy</li>
<li>A pharmacist performs a comprehensive final check of your chemotherapy</li>
<li>Your chemotherapy is picked up by your chemotherapy nurse</li>
<li>2 chemotherapy nurses check to make sure your chemotherapy order, blood test results, and chemotherapy are correct</li>
</ul>


<p>Once all the safety checks have been complete the nurse will administer fluids (to keep you hydrated), anti-nausea medication and the chemotherapy drug through your catheter.</p>

<p class="question invisible">How long does this take? Can the caregiver remain with the patient?</p>


<div class="feedback remove invisible">
#### During your Chemotherapy
Your chemotherapy will take several hours to administer, so you will be provided with meals.</div>


<p></p>

<p>During your chemotherapy your healthcare team will use this time to talk to you about the rest of your transplant journey.</p>

<p>The healthcare team will make sure that the logistics of the next few days are clear - what happens on transplant day and what happens after your transplant.</p>

<p>They will talk to you about the side effects you'll start to experience after your chemotherapy. You'll be given printed materials that explain these side effects in detail and you'll be shown what to do if you need to get help while you are in your apartment/hotel.</p>

<p>You will be introduced to the "Patient Temperature and Oral Intake Diary" that you and your caregiver will use to record your temperature and hydration every four hours while you are awake. The diary is included at the back of this guide.</p>

<p>You will be given a digital thermometer and instructed on how to take your temperature.</p>

<p>You and your caregiver should use the day of chemotherapy to ask as many questions as possible; make sure you are absolutely satisfied that you have all the information you need. Your healthcare team will do everything they can to answer your questions.</p>

<div class="feedback remove invisible">
#### After Chemotherapy
</div>


<p>When your treatment is finished you will return home to your apartment or hotel. <span class="feedback invisible remove">You will rest for one day before your transplant.</span></p>

<p class="move invisible">Move this or rewrite: During this period your blood cell counts will be very low. You will be at high risk for infection until your bone marrow begins to make new blood cells. To reduce the risk, everyone who enters your room will follow special rules. Your doctor and nurse will explain these in detail.</p>


<h4>Side Effects of Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>Your chemotherapy will kill the cancerous cells in your body and will prepare your bone marrow to receive your transplant. However, the side effects associated with chemotherapy are not to be taken lightly. These side effects will include the loss of your ability to heal and fight infections, infertility, hair loss, fatigue, nausea, mouth sores and mouth tenderness.</p>

<p>Your healthcare team will help you understand and prepare for these side effects. Before you receive your chemotherapy make a list of questions that you would like to ask about these side effects. Talk through these questions with your caregiver and your healthcare team.</p>

<p class="question invisible">What about peripheral neuropathy?</p>


<p class="dmz">Draft 2 (Incorporating second round of feedback from SK and CW): This is where I am right now. Everything after this is content from an older draft. </p>


<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Infertility</h4>

<div class="feedback remove invisible">This section has to be edited and possibly moved.
Chemotherapy drugs that kill rapidly-dividing cancer cells will also affect your fertility. It's likely that you will not be able to conceive a child naturally after your treatment. However, there are ways of preserving your fertility that may allow you to have a child in the future.</div>


<p>Cancer treatments for your transplant will effect your fertility. It is likely that you will not be able to conceive a child naturally after undergoing treatment for your transplant. If you have received chemotherapy in the past there is a risk that your sperm or eggs have already been damaged. If you want to learn more about options or other ways to build a family after your transplant ask your doctor or nurse for a referral to a fertility expert.</p>

<h5>Options For Men</h5>

<p>Men can freeze sperm before treatment. The first step is to schedule an appointment at a sperm bank, where you will masturbate and collect your ejaculated fluid in a sterile cup.</p>

<p>The sperm bank will analyze the specimen to be sure there are healthy sperm to freeze. The semen is then placed in vials and frozen. It can be stored for as long as you want, even for many years. We recommend that men collect three separate specimens if possible, abstaining from sex for two to five days before the first collection and between the other collections.</p>

<p>For more information please read:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sperm Banking (http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/899.pdf)</li>
<li>Cancer and Fertility: Information for Men (http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/713.pdf)</li>
</ul>


<h5>Options For Women</h5>

<p>Women can freeze eggs or embryos before treatment. <span class="outstanding invisible">(This is a little sparse/terse)</span>The first step is to schedule an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist (a doctor with special training in fertility). Ask your doctor or a member of your healthcare team to refer you to the reproductive endocrinologist.</p>

<p>The reproductive endocrinologist will evaluate your fertility and will give you advice on how best to proceed.</p>

<p>If these tests show you can be successful in collecting eggs, on or around the first day of your period you will start giving yourself daily hormone injections. This medicine will stimulate some of the eggs in your ovaries to mature. You will need the injections for about 10 days, during which you will be closely monitored by the reproductive endocrinologist. Once the eggs are fully mature, you will be scheduled for the egg retrieval. This is an outpatient procedure done using anesthesia so you will be asleep. The eggs are collected using a very thin needle passed through the wall of your vagina.</p>

<p>If you are going to store embryos, your eggs are fertilized with sperm in the laboratory (in vitro fertilization, IVF) before freezing. If you are going to store eggs, they are not fertilized with sperm before freezing. The frozen eggs or embryos can be stored for as long as you want, even for many years.</p>

<p>Another possible option to preserve fertility is ovarian tissue freezing. This is experimental.</p>

<p>For more information please read:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cancer and Fertility: Information for Women (http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/725.pdf)</li>
<li>Selecting a Reproductive Endocrinologist (http://www2.mskcc.org/patient_education/_assets/downloads-english/739.pdf)</li>
</ul>


<h5>Financial Issues</h5>

<p>Unfortunately, fertility preservation is not covered by most insurance plans. Sperm banking can cost up to about $1000, and egg or embryo freezing can cost $10,000 to $15,000. There are also annual storage fees. The financial staff at the sperm bank and reproductive endocrinologist will contact your insurance company to determine if you have coverage. There are financial resources available, including Fertile Hope, a discount programs for eligible patients managed through LIVESTRONG. For more information on this, ask you nurse for an application.</p>

<h5>Additional Considerations</h5>

<p>One thing to be aware of is that collecting sperm or eggs shortly after receiving chemotherapy may not be feasible.</p>

<p>Depending on the specific drugs you have received beforehand, and how much time has passed since your last treatment, there may be no sperm available to collect or eggs may not respond to stimulation. In addition, even if there are sperm or eggs to collect, if you had recent chemotherapy, they may have been damaged by recent treatment. There is a possibility that they will not fertilize or grow to form embryos. In addition, there is a risk of mutations and possible birth defects in a child conceived from these sperm or eggs. We have no data on outcomes of men and women who collect shortly after induction and/or consolidation and prior to transplant. Nevertheless, you may choose to attempt collection anyway.</p>

<p>If you would like to speak with someone to learn more about your options for fertility preservation, ask your doctor or nurse to refer you to our fertility nurse specialist or directly to a sperm bank or reproductive endocrinologist.</p>

<div class="feedback remove invisible">Chemotherapy drugs that kill rapidly-dividing cancer cells will also affect you fertility. It's highly likely that your chemotherapy will mean that you will not be able to conceive a child naturally - if you would like to have children in the future you can make arrangements to have your sperm or eggs frozen before your chemotherapy. Collecting and freezing sperm before your chemotherapy will enable you and your partner to attempt pregnancy when you are ready.

It's also very important that you speak to your insurance company. They will tell you if the costs associated with infertility treatment are covered under your policy. Even if your insurance does not cover infertility there may be other programs or grants that can help you pay for your infertility treatment. These are described in the Fertility and Cancer Treatment guides which are included at the back of this guide.

Typically **men** who want to have children after their chemotherapy opt to have their sperm collected and frozen, this is called sperm banking. 

If you are a man and wish to donate sperm you will travel to a sperm bank facility between one and three times. At the sperm bank you will ejaculate into a cup. The sperm bank will analyze the semen, counting the number of sperm. They will also study the shape of your sperm and their motility (ability to swim). If the sperm look healthy, the sperm bank will divide the specimen into small vials and freeze and store them. 

Sperm can be stored for as long as is necessary and a yearly storage fee will apply. 

**Women** who want to have children after their chemotherapy can have their eggs or fertilized embryos collected and stored beforehand. 

If you are a woman and wish to store your eggs or embryos for future fertilization, first the reproductive endocrinologist will examine you and review your medical history before discussing your options. 

If banking your eggs or embryos is an option and you decide to proceed on or around the first day of your period you will start giving yourself daily hormone injections. This medicine will stimulate your ovaries to make more eggs than usual. 

While you are taking the daily injections, you will see your reproductive endocrinologist every day or every other day for blood tests and transvaginal ultrasounds. 

Once you have enough mature eggs, you will give yourself a different injection to stimulate ovulation. Within 36 hours you will have an egg retrieval. The egg retrieval is an outpatient procedure done using anesthesia - you will be asleep and no surgical incision is needed. The eggs are collected using a very thin needle that is passed through your vagina. 

From this point it's possible to fertilize your eggs with sperm and freeze the resulting embryos. This is called embryo cryopreservation. 

An alternative to embryo cryopreservation is egg (oocyte) cryopreservation. This involves freezing eggs that have not been fertilized. When you are ready to use them, the eggs are thawed and fertilized with sperm. This is a newer technology and is still considered experimental but may be preferred by women who do not have a male partner during this time.

Whether you decide to freeze embryos or eggs, they will be stored at an egg bank until you are ready and you have been medically cleared to start a family. A yearly storage fee will apply. 

For more detailed information about infertility associated with cancer treatment and your options you should consult the Fertility and Cancer Treatment guides included at the back of this guide. These guides also list reproductive endocrinologists in the area. You should also talk with your bone marrow transplant doctor about options to preserve your fertility.

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Neutropenia and Low Platelet Level</h4>

<p>Your chemotherapy will severely damage your ability to fight infections and heal - it's important that you understand why this happens, how to watch for danger signs, and how to avoid infections and injuries.</p>

<p>One side effect of chemotherapy is called "neutropenia". Neutropenia is a condition where you have a a lower than normal number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in your bloodstream. Neutrophils play a crucial role in your immune system - they are one of the first types of cells that travel to the site of an infection. Once they reach the site of an infection they ingest and fight potentially harmful microorganisms.</p>

<p>Because your chemotherapy will kill your stem cells, you will lose the ability to make new neutrophils. Because your neutrophils are not being replaced the number of neutrophils in your bloodstream will drop to a very low level, leaving you at high risk of infections. You and your caregiver will work together to watch for any sign of infection. You'll keep a record of your temperature <span class="feedback remove invisible">and other vital signs,</span> even when you are in your hotel or apartment and you will have to take very careful precautions to avoid infections.</p>

<p>In addition to losing your ability to make neutrophils and other types of white blood cells, you'll also lose your ability to make <strong>platelets</strong>. Platelets <span class="feedback remove invisible">are little fragments of larger cells made in your bone marrow; they break off from these larger cells and flow through your bloodstream - living for just a few days before being replaced. They </span>clump together to help stop bleeding. Because you will have a very low platelet count after your chemotherapy you will need to take special care to avoid cuts and strenuous activities that might cause bleeding. You need to take special care of your gums and mouth, because it's quite common for bleeding to start here.</p>

<p>After your transplant your healthcare team will <span class="feedback remove invisible">regularly</span> take samples of your blood each day to count the number of neutrophils and platelets in your bloodstream.</p>

<p>As your stem cells take hold and start to make new blood cells the number of neutrophils in your bloodstream (sometimes referred to as your Absolute Neutrophil Count or ANC) will increase, as will your number of platelets (called your platelet count) - these are collectively known as "your counts" and they are key signs that your transplant has worked. You'll hear the term "counts" used frequently by your healthcare team.</p>

<p>More in-depth guides to living with neutropenia and low platelet levels are included later in this guide under Phase 3: After Your Transplant.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Diarrhea</h4>

<p>Diarrhea is frequent, loose, watery bowel movements. Diarrhea can also cause stomach cramps, gas, and pain in the stomach or rectal area. Diarrhea can be caused by cancer treatments, medications, infection, stress or other medical conditions. If you are having diarrhea you may become dehydrated due to loss of fluids and electrolytes. If your diarrhea continues for more than 24 hours call your doctor or nurse practitioner. Medications are available to treat diarrhea – do not take any over the counter medication until evaluated by your nurse practitioner or doctor.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Constipation</h4>

<p>Constipation is the passage of dry, hard stool that occurs when materials move too slowly through the large intestine. The normal length of time between bowel movements varies for each person. If you are having fewer bowel movements than what is normal for you or if you haven’t moved your bowels for more than two days you are constipated. There are many causes of constipation -- some causes include not drinking enough fluids or eating enough fiber, a decrease in your activity – not moving around or walking enough and side effects of certain medications and chemotherapy drugs. Medications are available to treat constipation. Talk with your nurse practitioner or doctor if you haven’t had a bowel movement for 2 days.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Mouth Sores</h4>

<p>Some chemotherapy drugs affect the rapidly dividing cells that line the mouth and digestive tract. This is known as mucositis. Mucositis can cause redness, swelling, tenderness and sores on the lining of your mouth, tongue and lips. You also may experience some mouth and throat discomfort that may make it difficult to eat or swallow.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Skin Changes</h4>

<p>Skin changes are common after transplant due to the effects of cancer treatment. Skin changes include increased dryness, flaking, discoloration and darkening. Your skin will be very sensitive to sun exposure and may sunburn very easily. Avoid bright sunlight and when outdoors wear sun block (SPF 30), protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts, long pants and a hat.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Hair Loss</h4>

<p>The chemotherapy that kills your rapidly-dividing cancer cells also kills the rapidly-dividing cells that produce your hair. Most patients will lose their hair during their transplant.</p>

<p>Losing your hair can be an unpleasant, upsetting experience. Like many patients, you might choose to cut your hair short before your transplant to take control of this process and to lessen the shock of losing your hair. Talk this through with your caregiver, friends and family.</p>

<p>Before your transplant is also a good time to think about whether you would like to wear a wig. Modern wigs can look very natural and wearing one might make you feel more comfortable. There are many wig stores in New York, a list of them is provided at the back of this guide. You can one while you still have your hair, or with a clipping of your hair, if you'd like your wig to match your natural hair.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Fatigue</h4>

<p>After your chemotherapy the number of red blood cells (RBCs) in your blood will be very low.</p>

<p>Red blood cells are the cells that transport oxygen around your body. Because the number of red blood cells in your blood will be low, oxygen will not travel around your body as easily as before. This will mean that you will feel tired. Your caregiver will need to help you carry out day to day activities until your red blood cell count returns to normal. Don't be afraid to ask for help, even with things you used to do with ease.</p>

<p>Even though you will feel tired after your chemotherapy and your transplant, you should still try to remain active - we have recommended some exercises and activities that you can do in section three.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Nausea and Vomiting</h4>

<p>Nausea and vomiting is a common side effect of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy acts on a specific part of your brain that may trigger nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can also be caused by stress or just the thought of having chemotherapy. The amount of nausea and vomiting you have will depend on your past experience and the type of chemotherapy you will receive. Sometimes you may experience nausea during your chemotherapy treatment or it may be delayed for several hours or days. It is important to manage nausea because it can keep you from eating and drinking.You will be given medication to prevent and control nausea prior to receiving chemotherapy. In addition you will be given a prescription for anti-nausea medication to take home with you. These medications work differently for each person. If the medication you are taking isn’t helping tell your nurse practitioner or doctor. You may need to try a different medication or take more than one kind of anti-nausea medication to feel better. Your healthcare team will work with you to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - The Importance of Communication</h4>

<p>Throughout your treatment it's very important that you communicate clearly with your healthcare team and your caregiver about your side effects.</p>

<p>Tell your healthcare team how you're feeling. Describe how your body feels. Describe how you're doing emotionally. Tell them if anything is worrying you. If you notice changes in how you feel describe what has changed. If anything bothers you, even if it seems minor, tell your healthcare team. The more information you can communicate to your healthcare team the more they'll be able to help you. There is usually something that they can do to make you feel more comfortable.</p>

<h3>Rest Day</h3>

<p>The day after you receive your chemotherapy is a rest day. This rest day allows the chemotherapy drug to work and then leave your body. When you receive your stem cells there will be no trace of the chemotherapy drug in your body, so the transplanted stem cells will not be harmed.</p>

<h4>Monitoring Temperature and Fluid Intake</h4>

<p>From now on your caregiver must take your temperature every four hours and write it in the "Temperature and Oral Intake Diary".</p>

<p class="question invisible">Where does the caregiver get the thermometer from?</p>


<p>If your temperature is 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher your caregiver needs follow the instructions on your BMT Emergency Guide; if it is between 8am and 8pm call the Outpatient BMT Clinic at (212) 639-2399. If it is after 8pm call (212) 639-2000 and ask for the doctor covering bone marrow transplant.</p>

<p>It's really important that you drink a lot of fluids from now on. As well as taking your temperature your caregiver will also monitor all of the fluids you drink and record the volume you drink in the Intake Diary. You should drink 2 liters or 64 fluid ounces of fluids each day. Try to drink steadily throughout the day; little and often.</p>

<p>Your caregiver should bring the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary to the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day. A nurse practitioner will review the diary with you.</p>

<p class="question invisible">Do we need to describe what should happen on the rest day? Has the caregiver already been monitoring the patient's vitals and fluid intake, or is this the first day?</p>


<h3>Other Things to Consider in Phase 1</h3>

<p class="outstanding">Need to bring the childcare, pets, exercise, emotional support in here. Need input from the Social Work team; this is pending. They are aware that I need content.</p>


<h4>Sexual Activity</h4>

<div class="outstanding">This section has to be edited and possibly moved.</div>


<p>Sexual activity provides pleasure and intimacy for many people. The information below can serve as a guide to being sexually active in a safe way after your transplant.</p>

<p>Use Birth Control to Prevent Pregnancy
If a woman becomes pregnant with sperm or eggs damaged by exposure to radiation, chemotherapy, or other anticancer medications, there is a risk of miscarriage or birth defects. Your or your partner should use contraception (birth control) throughout your cancer treatment.
It is important to pick a method of birth control that fits your lifestyle but will also be effective. Condoms used correctly are very effective in preventing pregnancy. Women can speak with their gynecologists to choose between the many available options.
Protect Yourself from Infection or Bleeding
You will be at increased risk of infection for many months after your treatment. Until your doctor tells you that your immune system has recovered:
• Use latex condoms each time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex.
• Use a barrier device (condoms or dental dams) any time your partner’s saliva, vaginal secretions, or semen could enter your mouth.
• Abstain from any sexual activity that could expose your mouth to feces.
In some situations, you may even be advised to avoid sex that involves penetration or contact with mucous membranes while your counts are low. This includes vaginal, oral, and anal sex or inserting fingers, vibrators, or sex toys into your vagina or anus. Hugging, cuddling, gentle touching, and kissing skin are other ways you can be intimate with your partner during this time.
Consider Steps to Avoid Exposing Your Partner to Chemotherapy and Other Anticancer Medications
There is little data about how much anticancer medication gets into a person’s body fluids, and even less on whether this poses any risk to a sexual partner. If this is a concern to you, consider using a barrier device whenever your partner may have contact with your semen (if you are male) or vaginal fluids (if you are female). Barrier devices include condoms and dental dams. We don’t know how long these medications may be in body fluids, but you could use barrier devices each day you have chemotherapy and for 1 week afterward.</p>

<h3>Checklist</h3>

<p>Before your outpatient treatment starts, there are a number of arrangements to make and options to consider. Use this checklist to keep track of things you need to do before your transplant.</p>

<ul>
<li>Read this guide in full at least once, along with the accompanying information and guides. Make note of anything that isn't clear, isn't answered, and any other questions you have.</li>
<li>Meet with the representative from Patient Financial Services (PFS) and talk to your health insurance company. Check your coverage for an outpatient bone marrow transplant and your prescription drug coverage.</li>
<li>Choose a caregiver and make sure they understand what the role entails.</li>
<li>Give your caregiver a copy of this guide and ask them to read it in full at least once</li>
<li>Attend the online orientation for Outpatient Autologous Stem Cell Transplant patients. Ask your BMT Nurse Coordinator for details.
<span class="feedback remove invisible">* Arrange lodging in a hotel or apartment near MSKCC</span></li>
<li>Arrange transportation to bring you from your home to your lodging</li>
<li>If you have children, arrange for childcare</li>
<li>Arrange for pet care
<span class="feedback invisible remove">* Purchase a thermometer and ensure your caregiver knows how to accurately take your temperature with it</span></li>
<li>Make an appointment with a fertility specialist to discuss the impact of your treatment on your ability to have children in the future.</li>
<li>Think about whether you'd like to cut your hair</li>
<li>Visit a wig store if you decide to wear a wig</li>
<li>Purchase a tote bag or rolling bag to carry your supplies to clinic every day</li>
<li>Make a list of questions that you would like to ask about the your treatment.</li>
<li>Talk through your list of questions with your caregiver and your healthcare team</li>
</ul>


<p class="outstanding">This will be a checkable list - circles where the patient and the caregiver can check-off items. We need to validate this list and add anything else we think is relevant.</p>




<div class="phasedivider">End of Phase Divider</div>


<h2>Phase 2 - Your Transplant</h2>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Diagram of the transplant process/timeline with a "you are here" marker on Phase Two, or highlighting of some kind.</p></div>


<h3>One Page Summary of This Phase</h3>

<p>Phase 2 of your treatment last just one day. On Day 0, your transplant day, your stem cells will be taken from storage and infused into your body through your catheter.</p>

<p>These are the key things that will happen during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stem Cells Retrieved - Your stem cells will be taken from storage and thawed.</li>
<li>Transplantation - Your stem cells will be infused into your body through your catheter.</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these activities in detail later in this section.</p>

<h4>Topics</h4>

<p>It's also important that you know about these topics during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Topic 1</li>
<li>Topic 2</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these topics in detail later in this section.</p>

<p class="question invisible">It probably makes more sense to speak about living with neutropenia, monitoring symptoms, infection control in phase three. This is such a short phase that there may be no other topics worth adding into this section. TBD. </p>


<h4>Actions - Things You Need to Do</h4>

<p>At the end of this chapter you'll find a list of things we need you to do during this phase of your treatment. Read this section in full then start to work your way through this list of actions.</p>

<h3>Transplant Day</h3>

<p>Now that you've received chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells in your body, it's time for your transplant. You will be given your infusion of stem cells, your transplant, on Day 0 of your specific treatment plan. The stem cells that were separated from your blood and frozen earlier will be re-infused into your body. These stem cells will give you back your ability to make new blood cells and fight infections.</p>

<h4>The Morning Before Transplant</h4>

<p>On the morning of Day 0, your transplant day, you and your caregiver should come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic at MSKCC's main campus at 8am. Give yourself extra time to get to the clinic, as you may feel tired after your chemotherapy. Bring newspapers, books, a laptop or tablet computer to pass the time.</p>

<p>Once you arrive at the BMT Outpatient Clinic a nurse practitioner will review ask you a set of questions and review your Patient Temperature and Oral Intake Diary. You will be brought to a private room for a physical exam and your vital signs will be checked.</p>

<p class="question invisible">I'd like to get a clear picture of what exactly happens when the patient gets to the clinic. </p>


<h4>Your Stem Cell Infusion</h4>

<p>Before the stem cell infusion, your "transplant", your frozen stem cells will be removed from storage in the stem cell laboratory <span class="feedback remove invisible">at our blood bank</span> and brought to your room. The stem cells are stored in clear plastic bags that look like a bag of blood. The bags will be placed in a warm water bath to thaw.</p>

<p>You will be given medications about 30 minutes before your transplant to help reduce any side effects effects that you may experience during the infusion.</p>

<p>Once the stem cells are thawed, the nurse practitioner or doctor will infuse the stem cells into your body through your catheter. You will be closely observed and your vital signs will be checked frequently during and after the infusion.</p>

<p><strong>Check meaning: The potential reactions that occur are caused by the preservative used to protect the stem cells during freezing.</strong></p>

<p class="question invisible">How long does the transplant (the infusion of the stem cells) take from start to finish?</p>


<p>The common side effects are nausea, vomiting, a tickle in your throat, or a cough. Other reactions that can occur include low blood pressure, chills and fever. It's important that you communicate with the healthcare team and with your caregiver during your transplant. Let your healthcare team know how you're feeling and tell them if you experience any side effects. If you experience side effects you will be treated for the symptoms.</p>

<p>During and after your transplant you may notice a strong, garlic-like taste in your mouth. Your urine, sweat, and skin may also have a garlic-like smell. This is caused by the preservative used to store your stem cells. The smell will gradually go away over 1 to 2 days. The Nutrition Department will give you lemons to cut up and use as safe, natural air-fresheners.</p>

<p>You may not notice the smell of the preservatives but those around you will. Your urine may appear bloody for 24 hours after your stem cells are infused into your body. This is your body's way of getting rid of the byproducts of the stem cells that are not needed.</p>

<p class="question invisible">I just want to validate that the small could be present during *and* after the transplant. Also, when it's mentioned that "The Nutrition Department will provide lemons" - how is it envisaged that the lemons are used. Cut them, leave them around? Why lemons, because they're natural, non-chemical, non-toxic?</p>


<h4>After Your Transplant</h4>

<p class="question invisible">What happens directly after the transplant? I'd like to travel with the patient from the room where they receive their transplant to their hotel/apartment.</p>


<p>After your stem cells are infused through your catheter you will remain in your hospital room for 4-6 hours for observation. After that you will be allowed to return home to your hotel or apartment to rest.</p>

<h4>Engraftment</h4>

<p>Almost immediately after your stem cells are infused into your body they will travel through your bloodstream into your bone marrow.</p>

<p>Once the stem cells arrive in your bone marrow they begin to "engraft". Engraftment is when your body accepts the transplant and your white blood cell count returns. White blood cell engraftment usually occurs about 10-14 days following your transplant, but this may vary depending upon your disease and exact treatment. Platelets and red blood cells usually take a little longer to recover than white blood cells.</p>

<p>The Chemotherapy you received add all your blood cells. During the time that you are waiting for engraftment you may need to have blood and platelet transfusions. You'll be given injections of growth factor - drugs that will speed up the production of white blood cells in your body.</p>

<p>Remember, you are very vulnerable to infection at this time. You will be closely monitored for any signs of infections. Your best defense against infection is hand washing. When your cells start to engraft you mary experience bone pain or a rash on your body. These are common symptoms experienced during engraftment.</p>

<p>They'll begin to divide and differentiate, creating more stem cells and making the different components of your blood including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.</p>

<h3>Other Things to Consider in Phase 2</h3>

<p class="question">I don't believe there are any in-depth topics to add in here. Probably best to talk about living with neutropenia, low platelet count, diet etc. in the next phase. Happy to add supplementary information to the transplant here though - suggestions welcome. </p>


<h3>Checklist</h3>

<p class="outstanding">This will be a checkable list - circles where the patient and the caregiver can check-off items. We need to validate this list and add anything else we think is relevant.</p>


<h2>Phase 3 - After Your Transplant</h2>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Diagram of the transplant process/timeline with a "you are here" marker on Phase Three, or highlighting of some kind.</p></div>


<h3>One Page Summary of This Phase</h3>

<p>Now that you've had your transplant, you enter a period of watching and waiting for engraftment to occur. As engraftment occurs the number of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets in your blood will return to normal - the amount of these cells, called your "counts", will be monitored daily.</p>

<p>After your transplant you will remain in a nearby apartment or hotel and will return to the BMT Clinic each day to have your progress evaluated and to have adjustments made to your treatment.</p>

<p>These are the key things that will happen during this phase:</p>

<p class="outstanding">To be written</p>


<p>We cover each of these activities in detail later in this section.</p>

<h4>Topics</h4>

<p>It's also important that you know about these topics during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Topic 1</li>
<li>Topic 2</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these topics in detail later in this section.</p>

<h4>Actions - Things You Need to Do</h4>

<p>At the end of this chapter you'll find a list of things we need you to do during this phase of your treatment. Read this section in full then start to work your way through this list of actions.</p>

<h3>Maintaining the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary</h3>

<p>After your transplant your caregiver must continue to take your temperature every four hours and write it in the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary.</p>

<p>If your temperature is 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher your caregiver needs follow the instructions on your BMT Emergency Guide. Your caregiver will also monitor all of the fluids you drink and record the volume you drink in the Intake Diary. You should drink 2 liters or 64 fluid ounces of fluids each day. Try to drink steadily throughout the day; little and often.</p>

<p>Your caregiver should bring the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary to the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day. A nurse practitioner will review the diary with you.</p>

<h3>The Outpatient BMT Clinic</h3>

<p>You will receive all your care in the outpatient BMT clinic on a daily basis. Each morning you will return to the Outpatient BMT Clinic. You should arrive at 8am. You will remain at the clinic for most of the day. Bring newspapers, books, a laptop or tablet computer or other things to pass the time.</p>

<p>When you come to the clinic you should wear every-day, comfortable clothing that allows for easy access to your catheter; shirts that open at the front, sweatshirts, large t-shirts. Nothing that is too difficult to take off or put back on again.</p>

<p>You should bring these items to the clinic with you each day:</p>

<ul>
<li>A list of all prescription and non-prescription medications you are taking with dosages and frequency. This should include vitamins, nutritional supplements, herbal products and over-the-counter drugs.</li>
<li>All the prescription medications you were instructed to take during the bone marrow transplant period.</li>
<li>Your temperature and oral intake record</li>
</ul>


<p>Once you arrive you will check in with the session assistant. A nurse practitioner will sit with you and your caregiver and you'll be asked a series of questions about how you feel. The nurse practitioner will check the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary.</p>

<p>Once you've checked in, you'll be brought to an examination room where you'll be examined physically and your vital signs will be checked.</p>

<p>Some of your blood will be taken and sent for testing. Your blood will be checked to see how your white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets are recovering. Your blood will also be checked for any signs of infection such as the presence of harmful bacteria or viruses.</p>

<p class="question">Any details we can add here would be great. What happens during clinic visits. If you can bullet I can write up.</p>


<p>Once you've been examined you will wait in the Outpatient BMT Clinic for your test results to return. This can take several hours. This is a good time for your caregiver to take a break; he or she can take some personal time or run errands. You will be safe in the care of the Outpatient BMT team. We highly recommend that caregivers leave the hospital and take this time to unwind.</p>

<p>After several hours, your test results (sometimes referred to as "labs") will come back from the lab. Your healthcare team will analyze the results and will make decisions about your care. The rest of your visit to the Outpatient BMT Clinic that day will depend on the results of your tests.</p>

<p>Here are some things that can happen based on the results of your tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>You could be given fluids to hydrate you</li>
<li>You could be given an infusion of platelets, red blood cells or other blood components</li>
<li>Your medication could be changed</li>
<li>Your treatment could be left as-is</li>
</ul>


<p>All of this will be explained to you. You'll remain in the clinic until any actions the healthcare team have recommended have been completed. Once your healthcare team is happy, you'll be free to leave. You'll return to your apartment or hotel where your caregiver will continue to monitor your temperature and fluid intake.</p>

<p>You'll continue to make daily visits to the clinic until your healthcare team decide that you can come less regularly.</p>

<p>If at any time you need more care than can be provided to you in the outpatient clinic you will be admitted to the inpatient BMT unit.</p>

<h4>Visitor Information</h4>

<p class="outstanding">Reword this.</p>


<p>This information should be reviewed by your caregiver and any other visitors who are planning to come and see you during your transplant.</p>

<ul>
<li>No visitors are allowed who have any signs of a cold, flu or who have been exposed to any contagious illness. If you have any questions about who can visit please speak with a nurse, NP or physician.</li>
<li>Hand washing for 15-20 seconds is required before each visitor enters a patient’s room. Hand washing or use of a hand sanitizer (Purell&reg;) must be repeated each time the room is entered. There may be a need for additional precautions at other times – if needed there will be a sign on the patient’s door with instructions.<em> Visitors and caregivers must use the visitor’s restroom in the hallway. This is for the protection of the patient and to minimize bacterial spread in the room.</em> No fresh cut flowers or live plants are allowed in the patient’s room.* Children under the age of 12 are not allowed to visit or stay with you during your transplant period.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Living with Neutropenia</h3>

<p>As you know, your chemotherapy will kill not only the cancerous cells in your body, but also healthy stem cells that make the different types of cells in your blood. This is why you received a transplant.</p>

<p>Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, play a crucial role in your immune system. In the days and weeks after your transplant, while your transplanted stem cells are still engrafting, you will have a very low number of neutrophils in your bloodstream. This will leave you highly susceptible to infections.</p>

<p>You and your caregiver will take careful precautions to avoid infections while you are "neutropenic". These precautions will include eating a special, low-microbial diet (a diet that contains a low number of potentially harmful microorganisms), washing carefully, taking care of your mouth and other precautions.</p>

<h4>Avoiding Sources of Infection</h4>

<p>One of the best ways to avoid infection is to simply avoid sources of infection. This is easier said than done - you and your caregiver will need to be careful about seeing visitors, what you touch, where you go. While you are neutropenic you should try to <strong>avoid</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shaking hands with people. When you do shake hands with people use an antibacterial gel, such as Purell<span class="superscript">&reg;</span> afterwards</li>
<li>Contact with young children, including your children if they are under 12</li>
<li>Contact with animals, including your pets - they cannot stay with you during your transplant</li>
<li>Contact with soil or dirt - you should not keep any plants in your hotel or apartment and should not accept gifts of flowers or plants</li>
<li>Contact with people who have had colds or recent illnesses</li>
</ul>


<p>Telling people who love you and want to make sure that you're okay that you can't see them can be difficult, but you and your caregiver need to be vigilant. You can explain to them that it's just for a short period of time, and that by taking these precautions you are making sure that you can see them as soon as possible. They will understand.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you use a computer or tablet and programs like Skype, Google Talk/Hangouts, FaceTime to keep in touch with friends and family when you are neutropenic.</p>

<h4>Eating a Low-Microbial Diet</h4>

<p>After your chemotherapy, and until told otherwise by your healthcare team, you will need to eat what is called a low-microbial diet. This is a diet for people with weakened immune systems and low blood counts. A low microbial diet is a diet that contains fewer microbes (also called microorganisms) than would ordinarily be found in every-day foods. This diet helps to reduce the risk of food-borne illnesses caused by bacteria and other microbes found in some foods and drinks. Microbes are tiny living organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, yeast, and molds.</p>

<p>Microbes can attach to foods and grow, but you can't always see, smell, or taste them. They are more likely to grow on milk, unrefrigerated food, undercooked foods, certain fruits and vegetables, unpasteurized juices and vegetable sprouts - but in reality they can grow on any food.</p>

<p>Eating a diet that contains fewer microbes will help prevent you from getting sick.</p>

<p>You will need to take careful precautions with the food you eat, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buying foods that you know have been stored properly and are safe to eat</li>
<li>Storing food safely in your hotel or apartment</li>
<li>Keeping your kitchen very clean</li>
<li>Keeping your refrigerator clean</li>
<li>Handling food safely</li>
<li>Eating only food that you know has been prepared and cooked in keeping with a low-microbial diet</li>
<li>Cooking foods thoroughly</li>
</ul>


<p>Refer to the guide on "Low-microbial Diet and Safe Food Handling" at the back of this guide.</p>

<h4>Connecting with Children</h4>

<p class="outstanding">Move this, or discuss this topic early in the guide.</p>


<p>Children under 12 are not able to visit you during your transplant period because of the risk of infection. This separation will be difficult for you, your child, and the rest of your family. We know from past experience that patients with children experience a range of feelings and reactions related to this separation.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you take time to talk to one of the social workers about being separated from your children. You or your caregiver should ask your Nurse Practitioner, BMT Nurse Coordinator or any member of the healthcare team that you'd like to speak with one of the social workers and they will make sure to come and see you.</p>

<p>Here are some things that other patients have done to remain in contact with their children during their transplant.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a computer or tablet and programs like Skype, Google Talk/Hangouts, FaceTime to talk to your children regularly. Set up a time that you talk to them each day - like when they get home from school and before they go to bed. Get into a routine of using the computer to see them and talk to them.</li>
<li>Paint or create other crafts to send home. Craft supplies can be provided to you by the Patient Recreation Center. Ask one of your healthcare team to arrange for the Patient Recreation Center to bring supplies to you.</li>
<li>Use your phone to make an audio recording of yourself as you read your children's favorite stories. Upload these recordings to the web, give them to your caregiver, or e-mail them to your children. They can read along with these stories while listening to your voice.</li>
<li>Keep copies of your children's favorite stories with you in your apartment or hotel. At night you can use Skype to read along with them before they go to sleep.</li>
<li>Ask your children to decorate your apartment or hotel with pictures; your caregiver can bring them to you and you can show them hanging on the wall to your children over Skype.</li>
<li>Give your child a special coloring book or journal for times when they miss you are feelings are difficult. Your caregiver can bring the colorings to you. You can talk to your child about them over Skype or the phone.</li>
</ul>


<p>We understand that nothing will replace physical contact between you and your children, but we strongly encourage you to use all available technology and means at your disposal to maintain a strong bond with them while you are unable to see them due to your neutropenia.</p>

<h4>Showering and Bathing</h4>

<p>While you are neutropenic keeping yourself clean is very important.</p>

<p>You should shower or bathe daily. When you shower or bathe you should use soap that can kill germs. Look for the words "antibacterial" or "antimicrobial". Dial<span class="superscript">&reg;</span> is one example, but there are many others.</p>

<p>When you shower or bathe take extra care to make sure you wash yourself thoroughly. Begin with your upper body, then the middle section, and wash the lower area including your feet last. Wash carefully under your arms, in your anal and genital areas, and in any skin folds. Germs tend to live in these moist areas. You may shampoo your scalp with soap once a day.</p>

<p>After you urinate or move your bowels, wash your buttocks and genital area with antibacterial soap. You can also use moist wipes. Pat the area dry. Wash your hands well afterward.</p>

<p>When you wash or bathe take care of your catheter; detailed instructions on how to protect your catheter against water are included at the back of this guide.</p>

<p class="question invisible">Can the person use a razor or must they use an electric razor/shaver? Can the person use tampons - there's a general lack of information about what women do during their period. If you can bullet-point the key points I can write up.</p>


<h4>Mouth Care</h4>

<p>While you're neutropenic and have a low platelet count you will need to change the way you brush your teeth and care for your mouth. This will help to avoid infection and bleeding.</p>

<p>Follow these guidelines to take good care of your mouth:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will be given a mouthwash to rinse your mouth before and after meals and at bedtime. The number of rinses may be increased to every 2 hours, depending on how your mouth feels.</li>
<li>Use only the mouthwash that your nurse gives you. Do not use mouthwash or toothpaste from any store. These products irritate and dry the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat.</li>
<li>Use an ultra soft toothbrush. You may also use Toothettes<span class="superscript">&reg;</span> disposable foam sticks.</li>
<li>Do not use dental floss.</li>
<li>Avoid licking your lips. It increases drying and chapping.</li>
<li>Apply a lubricant like Chapstick <span class="superscript">&reg;</span> after you clean or rinse your mouth and every 2 to 4 hours as needed. This will help keep your lips moist.</li>
<li>To avoid an infection in your mouth, the doctor will prescribe an oral anti-fungal antibiotic.</li>
<li>If your mouth becomes sensitive, avoid hot, spicy, acidic, or coarse foods. You may prefer soft or liquid food served chilled or at room temperature.</li>
<li>If your mouth feels very painful, your doctor will prescribe medicine for the pain.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Living with a Low Platelet Count</h3>

<p>Platelets are little fragments of larger cells made in your bone marrow; they break off from these larger cells and flow through your bloodstream. They clump together to help stop bleeding. Because you will have a very low platelet count after your chemotherapy you and your caregiver will take special precautions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid sharp objects such as a razors, scissors, and nail clippers. You should only shave using an electric razor/shaver and not a razor that has a blade</li>
<li>Do not have manicures, pedicures, waxes, electrolysis or tattoos</li>
<li>Do not have any dental work done</li>
<li>Follow the guidelines on mouth care (above)</li>
<li>Do not use rectal suppositories, enemas, or tampons</li>
<li>Do not take your temperature rectally</li>
<li>Consider using stool softeners or laxatives if you are straining to have bowel movements</li>
<li>Avoid tight clothing or any clothing that you have to strain to put on or take off</li>
</ul>


<p>You should avoid any activity that may result in injury. This includes any:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contact sports</li>
<li>Climbing ladders</li>
<li>Strenuous exercise</li>
<li>Bicycling</li>
<li>Weight lifting</li>
</ul>


<p>You should take precautions when you are having sex. You should use lubrication if needed and avoid anal or oral intercourse. Avoid strong thrusting as this can cause bleeding.</p>

<p class="question">Are these guidelines correct? I had thought that barrier method contraception had to be used as well for BMT patients. These are the generic low platelet guidelines and as such might not cover auto BMT.</p>


<p>You should avoid medications that have not been explicitly prescribed to you by your medical team. Do not take:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aspirin or products that contain aspirin</li>
<li>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Advil<span class="superscript">&reg;</span></li>
<li>Vitamin E</li>
</ul>


<p>All of these drugs make it more difficult for your blood to clot and so are very dangerous for somebody like you with a limited ability to heal and clot.</p>

<p>Call your doctor if you develop any symptoms of bleeding. Be on the lookout for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Excessive bruising</li>
<li>A faint red rash on your trunk, arms or legs</li>
<li>Vaginal spotting or heavy menstrual bleeding</li>
<li>The appearance of broken blood vessels in the white of your eye</li>
</ul>


<p>If you notice that you are bleeding you should take these steps immediately:</p>

<ol>
<li>Apply direct pressure on the bleeding site.</li>
<li>After applying pressure, follow the BMT Emergency Guide; if it is between 8am and 8pm call the BMT Outpatient Clinic at (212) 639-2399. If it is after 8pm call (212) 639-2000 and ask for the doctor covering bone marrow transplant.</li>
<li>Apply ice over the bridge of your nose for nosebleeds.</li>
</ol>


<p>Call your doctor immediately if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have black bowel movements, blood in the stool, or rectal bleeding</li>
<li>Have blood in your urine</li>
<li>Have a headache that do not get better, blurred vision, or dizziness</li>
<li>Cough up blood, vomit blood or get a nose bleeds</li>
</ul>


<h3>Living with a Low Red Blood Cell Count (Anemia)</h3>

<p>Red blood cells carry oxygen to the tissues. We breathe in oxygen from the air and breathe out carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin in red blood cells carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues in all parts of the body. It then carries carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs.
Your chemotherapy will cause you to have a very low red blood cell count, a condition known as anemia. When your red blood cell count is low your body cannot carry oxygen as well. Anemia can make you feel tired and weak. You may also feel dizzy or lightheaded when changing positions quickly lying to standing.</p>

<p>Some of the side effects of anemia include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increased tiredness</li>
<li>Generalized weakness</li>
<li>Rapid heartbeat</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Pale skin</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have anemia, your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A transfusion</li>
<li>Rest</li>
<li>A diet high in iron (e.g., green leafy vegetables, liver, chicken)</li>
<li>Iron supplements</li>
</ul>


<p class="question">I assume that the diet/iron recommendations here don't apply to SCT patients?</p>


<h3>Receiving a Transfusion</h3>

<p>Your doctor may recommend a blood transfusion to boost the number of platelets or red blood cells in your body.</p>

<p>If your doctor recommends a transfusion for you it will be given to you through your catheter during one of your regular visits to the Outpatient BMT Clinic.</p>

<h4>Sourcing Blood for Your Transfusion</h4>

<p>The blood used in your transfusion is donated at our Blood Bank. There is no substitute for real blood, so we are incredibly grateful to the people who donate blood.</p>

<p>Your friends and relatives may donate red blood cells and platelets - this is known as a directed donation. Your friends and relatives are eligible to donate if they:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are between 16 and 75 years old. No parental consent is required for those who are at least 17 years old.</li>
<li>Weigh at least 110 pounds</li>
<li>Are in good health</li>
<li>Have not had an illness such as hepatitis, jaundice, cancer, etc</li>
<li>Do not have signs of a cold or active allergy at the time of donation</li>
<li>Have not taken aspirin, or any compound that has aspirin or aspirin-like drugs (Ibuprofen, Motrin<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>, Naprosyn<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>, Anaprox<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>, Advil<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>, Aleve<span class="superscript">&reg;</span>) within three days before giving blood.</li>
<li>Have identification showing their name and photograph or signature</li>
<li>Have not consumed alcohol eight hours before donating</li>
</ul>


<p>Blood donations can be given by appointment at our Blood Donor Room which is located at:</p>

<p>Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
Schwartz Building Lobby
1250 First Avenue
(Between 67th and 68th Streets)
New York, NY 10065</p>

<p>For more information about making a directed donation and to make an appointment, your friends and family should call our Blood Donor Room at 212-639-7643.</p>

<p>If your friend of family member has a blood type that isn't compatible with yours then their blood will be released for use with other patients at MSKCC.</p>

<p>Directed donations will be held for you for 30 days. After that, the blood will be released for use with other patients at MSKCC.</p>

<h4>Making Sure Blood Is Safe</h4>

<p>After it is donated all blood is tested for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Syphilis</li>
<li>Hepatitis B and C</li>
<li>Exposure to the AIDS virus</li>
<li>The presence of a virus associated with a very rare form of leukemia.</li>
<li>West Nile virus</li>
<li>Trypanosoma Cruzi</li>
</ul>


<p>The chance of getting any of these from donated blood is very small. Directed donations are tested in exactly the same way as other donations.</p>

<h4>How long does the Transfusion take?</h4>

<p>A transfusion of red blood cells usually takes two to four hours. Transfusions of other blood components, like platelets, takes only 15-30 minutes.</p>

<h4>Are there risks associated with blood transfusions?</h4>

<p>Yes, blood transfusions have some risks. These risks include the very slight chance of having an allergic reaction or acquiring an infection through tainted blood.</p>

<p class="question">Are these risks worth mentioning?</p>


<h4>Can anything bad happen during or after the transfusion?</h4>

<p>Transfusions sometimes cause reactions. The most common symptoms are fever, chills, and hives. These can be treated with a variety of medicines. Transfusion reactions are rarely life threatening. Nursing staff constantly check all patients while a blood transfusion is taking place.</p>

<h4>Is there anything to worry about after a transfusion?</h4>

<p>Allergic reactions can sometimes occur. Symptoms are listed below. They can occur up to 48 hours after the transfusion. Call your doctor immediately if you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fever (100.4 F or 38 C or higher) or chills.</li>
<li>Flushing of the face.</li>
<li>Hives, rash, or itching.</li>
<li>Trouble breathing or shortness of breath.</li>
<li>Low back pain.</li>
<li>Nausea or vomiting.</li>
<li>Weakness or fainting.</li>
<li>Blood in the urine.</li>
<li>Chest pain (If you have chest pain, call your local emergency number immediately.).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p>Exercise is an important part of the recovery process during and following stem cell transplantation. Benefits of exercise include preventing loss of endurance, muscle strength and bone density. Exercise can also prevent respiratory and circulatory problems and improve your ability to be as independent as possible.</p>

<p>While in the outpatient transplant program you will be walking to and from the hospital daily which will help to maintain your conditioning. During the hours you are in clinic you are encouraged to walk in the hallways (wearing a mask and gloves) two to three times daily. While you are staying locally in the hotel you are encouraged to walk outside weather permitting.</p>

<p>If you have special needs you will be seen by a physical therapist for an evaluation.</p>

<h3>Other Things to Consider in Phase 3</h3>
