<p class="question hidden"><span class="complete">Some of the topics align neatly to phases, some don't. Should we summarize the most important information about topic, then refer to a more complete version in the appendix? That would be my recommendation. Say for example we are in Phase 2, could we summarize issues related to fertility, then refer the person to a longer guide at the back of our guide?)</span> Decision: Yes, summarize and refer to complete guides.</p>

<h2>Bone Marrow Basics</h2>

<h3>What is Bone Marrow, What Are Stem Cells?</h3>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: We should draw a diagram of this process; marrow->stem cells->differentiated cells. The stock ones available online are not good and we can do better.</p></div>


<p>Bone marrow is a substance found in the spaces in the center of the larger bones in your body; your hip, breastbone and pelvis.</p>

<p>Your bone marrow is where the different types of blood cells are made - including the white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that carry oxygen and and platelets that clot to stop you bleeding.</p>

<p>But, you might ask, how are these blood cells "made"?</p>

<p>Bone marrow contains a large number of what are called stem cells. Stem cells are young blood cells; they can create many copies of themselves - <em>dividing</em> again and again to create more stem cells.</p>

<p>Your stem cells can also follow a path called <em>differentiation</em>, where they change into the different types of blood cells found in your body.</p>

<p>Stem cells are constantly dividing and differentiating in our bone marrow creating new blood cells to replace older cells.</p>

<h3>Why You Need a Transplant</h3>

<p>You have malfunctioning, cancerous cells in your body - and these cells are diving rapidly. Your type of cancer responds to high doses of chemotherapy, a form of cancer treatment that uses chemicals to kill these rapidly dividing cells.</p>

<p>One drawback of chemotherapy is that it also kills other types of rapidly dividing cells in your body - including the stem cells that produce your blood.</p>

<p>When you receive chemotherapy to kill the cancerous cells in your body your bone marrow will be wiped out and you will lose the ability to make new blood cells.</p>

<p>Because you can't make new blood cells, your immune system and your body's ability to renew itself are compromised.</p>

<p>This is why you need a transplant.</p>

<h3>What is an Autologous Transplant?</h3>

<p>Autologous means <em>from yourself</em> - an autologous bone marrow transplant, also called an autologous <em>stem cell</em> transplant, is one where stem cells are collected (also called "harvested") from your body before you receive your chemotherapy. These stem cells are stored safely while you receive your chemotherapy, then given back to you. You are literally receiving a transplant from yourself.</p>

<p>An autologous transplant has three key phases:</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of the process of harvesting/collection. Apheresis. </p></div>


<p><strong>Before</strong> - You prepare for your transplant. You are fitted with a catheter. You receive drugs that stimulate your body to make more stem cells than normal. Your stem cells are harvested from your body and stored. You receive your chemotherapy, called the "conditioning regimen", to kill cancer cells. Your stem cells are also killed and you lose your ability to make new blood cells.</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of chemotherapy being given through the catheter. </p></div>


<p><strong>During</strong> - You have lost your ability to make new blood, so your immune and healing systems are compromised. Your stem cells are taken from storage and re-infused back into your body.</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of the process of engraftment. </p></div>


<p><strong>After</strong> - The re-infused stem cells find their way through your bloodstream to your bones. Over time they take hold in your bones, a process called "engraftment". They begin to divide and create healthy, new blood cells. Your immune and vital systems begin to return.</p>

<p>Each patient's journey is a little different; your medical team will be able to explain your transplant in more detail.</p>

<h3>What is an Outpatient Bone Marrow Transplant?</h3>

<p>Until relatively recently, bone marrow transplants were always done on an inpatient basis; you would live in the hospital during your chemotherapy, transplant and some of your recovery period.</p>

<p>Now, bone marrow transplants like yours can be done on an outpatient basis. This means that while you are receiving your treatment, you will stay in a local hotel or apartment. Every day you will come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic for blood work, vital signs, weight and physical examination. You will only be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay if you develop complications.</p>

<p>Here is a typical timeline for an outpatient transplant:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Day −4:</em> You and your caregiver check into a hotel or apartment close to MSKCC's main campus in Manhattan.</li>
<li><em>Day −3:</em> You and your caregiver come to MSKCC's Interventional Radiology department at main campus where you are fitted with a central venous catheter. You return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.</li>
<li><em>Day −2:</em> You come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic where you receive your chemotherapy. You return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.</li>
<li><em>Day −1:</em> This is a rest day; you remain in your hotel or apartment for the day.</li>
<li><em>Day 0:</em> Transplant day. You come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic where you receive your stem cell transplant. You return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.</li>
<li><em>Day +1 to +12:</em> You will visit the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day to have blood work done, your vital signs checked and a physical examination. You'll also receive hydration, electrolytes and transfusions if necessary. You return to your hotel or apartment every evening.</li>
</ul>


<p>After <em>Day +12</em> your central venous catheter will be removed. If you live within one hour of MSKCC's main campus you can return home. If you live further away you will stay at your local hotel or apartment for an additional two weeks. You will visit the Outpatient BMT Clinic twice a week, instead of every day.</p>

<p>You'll see that the days leading up to your transplant are given minus number; Day −3, Day −2 etc. The day of your transplant is Day 0, and the days that follow are Day +1, Day +2 etc. Your healthcare team will use this format when they explain your transplant to you.</p>

<p class="move invisible">Move: While you are in the outpatient clinic you will be cared for in a private room that has a bed and bathroom. A light breakfast and lunch will be provided for you. There is a communal lounge with coffee and tea for caregivers.</p>


<h2>Your Transplant Team</h2>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Photograph of the outpatient transplant team would work, if printing is not an issue.</p></div>


<p>A team of healthcare professionals from the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service will care for you.</p>

<p>Your <em>attending doctor</em> will be in charge of your care throughout your treatment. Fellows, nurse practitioners, hospitalists and house staff are also partners in your care. <em>Should we give the names of some attending doctors?</em></p>

<p>A <em>fellow</em> is a doctor who has completed general training and is receiving additional training in cancer care.</p>

<p>A <em>nurse practitioner</em> is a nurse who has a master's or doctoral degree. The nurse practitioner is licensed to examine you, provide medical treatments and prescribe medications.</p>

<p>Your <em>BMT Nurse Coordinator</em> will work with you and your team of doctors to organize all the testing, procedures and consults with other professionals required prior to your transplant.  This nurse will also provide you with treatment calendars describing the timeline for your plan of care and education about the pre-transplant process</p>

<p>The <em>hospitalist</em> is a doctor who only sees patients while they are in the hospital. At MSKCC a hospitalist is on duty all night.</p>

<p><em>House staff</em> are doctors who are completing their residency. They work under the supervision of the fellows and attending doctors.</p>

<p>A team of <em>nurses</em> will provide your day-to-day nursing care.</p>

<p>A <em>Clinical Pharmacist</em> who specializes in the care of transplant patients will review your medications with you and your caregiver, teaching you how to take them properly and to inform you of any side effects they may cause. The pharmacist will review your medications daily with the outpatient team.</p>

<p><em>Social Workers</em> are members of the healthcare team who will help you and your family manage the stresses that come with the transplant process. The social workers understand the issues faced by transplant patients and are on hand to listen, offer counseling and refer you or your family to other resources and services as needed.</p>

<p class="question invisible">What about the BMT Nurse Coordinator or the Transplant Coordinator?</p>


<p>While you are here, you will come to know all of the members of your team.</p>

<p class="question hidden"><span class="complete">Would it be useful to mention other support services here, PT, OT, Social Work? If we mention them, do we refer to them as the healthcare team, or as support services?</span> Decision: Yes, include social work and pharmacist - but not PT/OT</p>


<h2>Phase 1 - Before Your Transplant</h2>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Diagram of the transplant process/timeline with a "you are here" marker on Phase one, or highlighting of some kind.</p></div>


<p>Phase 1 of your treatment begins when you meet your Outpatient BMT team on or around Day −30 and runs all the way up to Day −1, a rest day following your chemotherapy.</p>

<h3>One Page Summary of This Phase</h3>

<p>In this phase you'll make preparations for your transplant; practically, physically and emotionally. This will be a very busy time for you and your family.</p>

<p>These are the key things that will happen during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Financial Clearance - You will work with your insurance company to make sure your treatment and medications are covered</li>
<li>Meeting your Team - You will meet your primary physician and members of the Outpatient BMT team</li>
<li>Choosing a Caregiver - You'll identify a family member or friend to act as your caregiver</li>
<li>Orientation - You and your caregiver will attend an orientation meeting</li>
<li>Side Effects - You will make decisions about your fertility, about wearing a wig and other issues related to the side effects of chemotherapy</li>
<li>Testing - You'll undergo a round of tests</li>
<li>Lodging - You'll move into a hotel or apartment near to MSKCC.</li>
<li>Catheter - Your central venous catheter will be fitted</li>
<li>Harvesting - Your stem cells will be collected and stored</li>
<li>Chemotherapy - You will receive high dose chemotherapy</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these activities in detail later in this section.</p>

<h4>Topics</h4>

<p>It's also important that you know about these topics during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Acknowledging and managing your <em>emotions</em></li>
<li><em>Remaining active</em> during your transplant and recovery</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these topics in detail later in this section.</p>

<p class="move">From the list of topics, move: What you can and cannot eat during transplant and recovery</p>


<h4>Actions - Things You Need to Do</h4>

<p>At the end of this chapter you'll find a list of things we need you to do during this phase of your treatment. Read this section in full then start to work your way through this list of actions.</p>

<p class="question hidden"><span class="complete">Should this be included at the end of each chapter?</span> Decision: Yes, actions at the end of the chapter.</p>


<h3>Meeting Your Team</h3>

<p>When does it happen: Around Day −30.</p>

<p class="outstanding">To be written</p>


<h3>Choosing Your Caregiver</h3>

<p>One of the most important steps as you prepare for your transplant is choosing your caregiver. This person is usually a family member or a close friend and will be an important part of your healthcare team.</p>

<p>Your caregiver will be responsible for a lot of the day to day medical, practical, emotional support you need during your outpatient transplant.</p>

<p>Your caregiver will be responsible for things such as:</p>

<h4>Medical Support</h4>

<ul>
<li>Gathering information from the healthcare team</li>
<li>Cleaning and caring for your catheter</li>
<li>Making sure you take your medications and keeping a written record of when you take your medications</li>
<li>Taking your temperature every 4 hours while you are awake and keeping a written record of your temperature</li>
<li>Keeping a written record of down how much fluid you drink every day</li>
<li>Noticing any changes in your condition</li>
<li>Telling your healthcare team about any symptoms you may have</li>
<li>Calling for medical help in an emergency</li>
</ul>


<h4>Practical Support</h4>

<ul>
<li>Dealing with financial and insurance issues</li>
<li>Preparing your meals according to a special, low-microbial diet</li>
<li>Bring you to and from the hospital</li>
<li>Maintaining a clean environment in your hotel, apartment or home</li>
<li>Keeping family members and friends up to date about your condition</li>
<li>Managing the number of visitors you have and keeping you away from anyone who is sick</li>
</ul>


<h4>Emotional Support</h4>

<ul>
<li>Paying attention to your moods and feelings</li>
<li>Communicating with you, listening to you</li>
<li>Understanding your needs and your decisions</li>
</ul>


<p class="question invisible"><span class="complete">I would like to write this bullet-point list into more fluid text, is that acceptable?</span> Decision: Yes, re-write.</p>


<p>While you're undergoing your transplant your caregiver will not be able to work. Your caregiver will need to remain with you for most of the day and night - though while you are in the Outpatient BMT clinic your caregiver can take some time for themselves; this is something we strongly recommend.</p>

<h4>Choosing the Right Caregiver</h4>

<p>Take time now to think about who you would like to be your caregiver. It should be somebody you trust who can take the time to care for you and who can offer you the support you need. Choose somebody you're comfortable communicating with and who can offer you the emotional support you need.</p>

<h3>BMT Orientation</h3>

<p class="question">To be written. I don't understand how the BMT Orientation works; research and write content. Does the face-to-face BMT orientation still happen?</p>


<h4>Resources for Caregivers</h4>

<p class="move">Need to check what this means: "There are many resources available at MSKCC for patients and caregivers. You can learn about them in the Resources section of this guide or by talking with your team."</p>


<h3>Financial Clearance</h3>

<h4>Insurance</h4>

<p class="outstanding">Summarize insurance issues, what the patient needs to do to get clearance. The role of Patient Financial Services. </p>


<h4>Financial Support</h4>

<p class="outstanding">Sources of financial assistance available to patients. What these grants cover, what they don't cover. How to apply. Social work team are going to offer relevant content. </p>


<h3>Pre-Transplant Medical Testing</h3>

<p>Before you receive your chemotherapy or undergo your transplant you will have some tests that will give us a good understanding of your baseline health and organ function. These tests will be done in the 30 days before your transplant (Day −30 onwards). The BMT Nurse Coordinator will work with you and your caregiver to schedule the tests.</p>

<p>It's likely that you'll receive these tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>A chest x-ray - done to ensure your lungs are clear and there is no evidence of a pneumonia or other problems</li>
<li>Blood tests - done to evaluate your baseline kidney and liver function, and to assess your white blood cell, hemoglobin and platelet counts</li>
<li>Urine tests</li>
<li>Electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (ECHO) or other tests that give information about your heart</li>
<li>Pulmonary function tests (PFT's) - breathing tests that measure lung function</li>
<li>Computerized axial tomography (CT) Scan - an x-ray that provides cross-sectional views and images of soft tissue as well as bone. It also provides measurements of your chest and is used to plan your radiation treatments.</li>
<li>Positron emission tomography (PET) Scan – a scan used to visualize physiologic function in body areas</li>
<li>Bone marrow aspiration - provides a sample of your bone marrow</li>
<li>Skeletal survey - An x-ray of the major bones in your body. This can take a few hours to do.</li>
</ul>


<p>The results of the tests will be used to plan your treatment and adjust it to your specific needs. The tests will help us to identify any changes to your body that occur during or after your treatment.</p>

<p>Your doctor and nurse will explain any other tests that you may need.</p>

<p class="question hidden"><span class="complete">When are these tests done, how are they scheduled? Also, is this list of tests accurate/complete? What about liver function test, biopsies etc.? Also, can we be any more specific about "blood tests" - what sort of blood tests? What is the purpose of the chest x-ray? I'd like to get more detailed, granular with this - this is our one shot to explain their testing.</span> Answer: These tests are part of the pre-transplant evaluation and are scheduled by the BMT Nurse Coordinator. They are done within 30 days prior to the transplant (to get a more complete picture of the patients baseline health and organ function prior to clearing to start high dose chemotherapy). The blood tests are done to evaluate baseline kidney, liver and hematological function (white blood cell, hemoglobin and platelet counts). A baseline chest X-ray is done to ensure the patient has "clear lungs" and no evidence of a pneumonia or other abnormalities.</p>


<h3>Moving into a Nearby Apartment or Hotel</h3>

<p class="question">To be written. How does the patient actually go about getting a space at the Helmsley. Who organizes this?</p>


<h3>Being Fitted with your Central Venous Catheter</h3>

<p>On or before Day −4 you and your caregiver come to MSKCC's Interventional Radiology department at main campus to be fitted with a central venous catheter.</p>

<h4>What is a Central Venous Catheter? Why Do I Need One?</h4>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: A clear diagram of the central venous catheter.</p></div>


<p>A central venous catheter is a tube inserted into a large vein near your collarbone. On the outside of your body the catheter divides into 2 or 3 smaller tubes called "lumens".</p>

<p>A central venous catheter allows your healthcare team to give you medicine, fluids, electrolytes, blood transfusions and chemotherapy without the need to stick you repeatedly with a needle. Having a catheter will make your treatment much more comfortable.</p>

<p>The catheter will stay in your body throughout your treatment and is usually removed around twelve days after you receive your stem cell transplant.</p>

<h4>Before Your Catheter is Fitted</h4>

<p>Before your catheter is fitted you shouldn't take aspirin, any products that contain aspirin, or vitamin E. You should also tell your doctor if you are taking any blood thinners or any medication for diabetes.</p>

<p class="question invisible">Do we need to state this or is the BMT Outpatient Team monitoring/communicating this?</p>


<p></p>

<p>Call your doctor before your procedure if you develop any illness. This includes a fever, cold, flu, or sore throat.</p>

<p>If you have been told to be on a clear liquid diet you shouldn't eat any solid food after midnight the night before your procedure and you should continue to drink clear liquids up to 2 hours before you arrive at the hospital for your procedure.</p>

<h4>The Day of the Catheter Fitting</h4>

<p>Your transplant coordinator will work with you to schedule the fitting of your catheter; it's likely that you'll be asked to report to the Surgical Day Hospital, where the catheter will be fitted, several hours before the procedure takes place. This will allow the medical team to evaluate you and make sure everything is in order before they fit the catheter.</p>

<p>You will probably already be staying in a nearby hotel or apartment. On the morning of the procedure you may shower, but you shouldn't apply any creams or lotions to your body. Take any medications you've been instructed to take.</p>

<p>If you wear contact lenses you should wear glasses on the day you are fitted for your catheter. If you don't own glasses then bring a container for your contact lenses to the hospital with you.</p>

<p>You and your caregiver should leave any valuables or jewelry at home. Bring only your medications and the money you need for the day to the hospital.</p>

<p>Enter the hospital through the main entrance at 1275 York Avenue. Take the M elevators at the top of the escalator to the 2nd floor. As you step off the elevator, enter the double doors to the Surgical Day Hospital. Check in at the desk. Please arrive on time.</p>

<p>In the SDH, you will change into a gown, robe, and slippers. When you are ready, you will be taken to Interventional Radiology.</p>

<h4>The Procedure</h4>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: A diagram or image showing the incision and placement of the catheter. The text is quite intimidating, so it'd be good to show the procedure in reasonable detail to allay fears.</p></div>


<p>The placement of the catheter should take about 30 minutes. First, an IV line will be started and you will be given some medication through the IV line to control pain and any anxiety; the medication will relax you. Your blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and oxygen levels will be monitored during your procedure.</p>

<p>Two areas of your body will be numbed with a local anesthetic. A small incision (surgical cut) will be made near your collarbone, usually at the base of your neck. This incision will be used to gain access to the vein where the catheter will be placed.</p>

<p>A second incision will be made on your chest, under your collarbone. The catheter will be inserted through this small incision and tunneled under your skin to the first incision. The catheter will then be threaded into the vein. You may feel a pulling sensation.</p>

<p>A cuff surrounds part of the catheter that lies in the tunnel. This cuff will become anchored in the tunnel about 3 to 4 weeks after your procedure. It prevents bacteria from entering the tunnel and traveling up to your vein. This decreases your risk of infection and prevents your catheter from falling out.</p>

<p>The incision near your collarbone will be stitched closed. The stitches will be absorbed and will not need to be removed. The outside of your incision will be covered with strips of adhesive tape. Your catheter will be stitched to your skin at the point where it exits your body so that it will stay in position. You will be able to see this thread around your catheter.</p>

<p class="question invisible">How long does the procedure take, does the patient need to recuperate at the SDH afterwards or do they go straight home? Useful to put a sense of time around the procedure.</p>




<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: A diagram of the catheter in place. </p></div>




<p class="question hidden">Is the person given supplies to take care of their catheter?</p>


<h3>After Your Catheter Has Been Fitted</h3>

<p>After your catheter has been fitted you will be monitored in the Surgical Day Hospital for 2-3 hours before being allowed to return to your hotel or apartment.</p>

<p class="question hidden">I assume that once the catheter has finished the person goes back to their apartment/hotel? Our story needs to travel home with them.</p>


<p>You will need to leave the dressings covering the incision near your collarbone in place and dry for 48 hours. You can remove these dressings after two days and can leave the site of the incision open to the air. The strips of adhesive tape that cover the incision should be left in place until they start to peel off. This should happen about 3 to 5 days after your catheter is fitted.</p>

<p class="question invisible">If the patient gets their catheter on Day-4 and it takes 3-5 days to heal, and weeks to completely anchor in place, doesn't this run into their chemotherapy and transplant (and beyond)? The text in the CVC guide doesn't address this (obviously, as it's a generic guide). Thoughts?</p>


<p>The point where the catheter exits your skin will still need to be covered with a dressing. The stitch at this site keeps your catheter in place until the cuff becomes fully anchored.</p>

<p>If you have discomfort at your incision sites or around the cuff ask your nurse for medication to relieve your pain.</p>

<h4>Taking Care of Your Catheter</h4>

<p>Taking good care of your catheter is important. A nurse will teach you how to care for your catheter. You will learn how to change your dressing while ensuring that it remains free from germs; this is known as "sterile technique". Using sterile technique will minimize your risk for infection. Your caregiver will learn how to change your dressing with you.</p>

<p>To take care of your catheter one of your nurses will give you  supplies including clean dressings, gauze pads, lumen caps, tape, clamps and other essentials.</p>

<p class="question invisible">When will a nurse teach you? Which nurse? Where does this happen?</p>


<p>Your catheter should not interfere with your day to day activities as you get ready for your transplant, but you should avoid strenuous activities and contact sports.</p>

<p>Prepare the following emergency kit and keep it with you at all times:</p>

<p class="question invisible">Where do we introduce the caps, clamps - this is the first time they're mentioned. What do they do in the case of an emergency? (This is covered in the full guide)</p>


<ul>
<li>Two catheter caps</li>
<li>One toothless clamp</li>
<li>Alcohol swabs</li>
<li>One roll of 2-inch tape</li>
<li>Two 2x2 gauze pads</li>
<li>Your doctor's office and emergency telephone numbers.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is a summary of the things you'll do on to take care of your catheter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change the Tegaderm&trade; dressing once a week</li>
<li>Change the caps on the lumens and flush the catheter twice a week</li>
<li>Clamp the catheter when it's not in use</li>
<li>Use a waterproof cover, called an Aquaquard&trade;, over your catheter when showering or bathing</li>
<li>Avoid submerging the catheter in water (e.g. in a swimming pool)</li>
<li>Keep your catheter secure, avoid pulling it or the lumens.</li>
<li>Tape the lumens to your skin, pin them to your clothing, or tape them to your bra if you're a woman.</li>
</ul>


<p class="question">What does this mean: Clamp the catheter when it's not in use</p>


<p>You and your caregiver should be on the look-out for any problems with your catheter. If you notice a discharge from your catheter (a liquid that can vary in color but which is likely to be clear, bloody or yellow/green) or if the exit site around the catheter is red, raw, or swollen, call your doctor. These may be signs of infection.</p>

<p class="question invisible">What does "has drainage" mean?</p>




<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Clamping the catheter above a leak.</p></div>


<p>If your catheter is leaking at any time, clamp it above the leak. Use the white catheter clamp on the catheter, if possible. Wipe the area that is leaking with an alcohol pad and then cover the leak with tape. Follow the instructions in your BMT Emergency Guide; if it is between 8am and 8pm call the BMT Outpatient Clinic. If it is after 8pm call your attending physician or go directly to the urgent care center.</p>

<p class="question invisible">Who specifically do they call? Call the BMT Outpatient clinic?</p>




<p class="question invisible">I edited "Cover the site with tape" rolling it into the sentence "Wipe the area that is leaking with an alcohol pad and then cover the leak with tape". The word "site" felt ambiguous and my assumption is that we're taking about putting tape over the leak.</p>


<p>Full instructions on how to care for your catheter are included in the <em>Caring for Your Central Venous Catheter</em> guide which is included in the appendices. You should read this guide in full and refer to it when you are changing your dressing or caring for your catheter.</p>

<h3>Mobilization and Harvesting</h3>

<p>In an autologous transplant your stem cells are collected ("harvested") from your body before you receive chemotherapy. They are re-introduced into your body after your chemotherapy; this is your stem cell transplant.</p>

<p>On or around Day −4 you will be given an injection of a drug that "mobilizes" your stem cells, then those stem cells will be collected or "harvested" from your bloodstream.</p>

<h4>Mobilization</h4>

<p>Normally your stem cells live in your bone marrow (though a few circulate in your bloodstream) where they are difficult to access and collect for transplantation.</p>

<p>Because of this, you'll be given injections of a drug called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF). GCSF stimulates your body to make more stem cells than usual and encourages them to move into your bloodstream where they can be collected much more easily. This process is called <em>mobilization</em>. GCSF drugs include filgrastim (Neupogen&reg;), pegfilgrastim (Neulasta&reg;) and plerixafor (Mozobil&reg;).</p>

<p>In most cases GCSF injections are self-administered, that is you will inject yourself with the drug while at home. You will be given the GCSF in pre-filled syringes, which you'll keep in your refrigerator. Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will create a personal <em>Mobilization Calendar</em> for you which will tell you when to give yourself the injections. The number of injections needed will depend on a number of factors, including your weight.</p>

<p>A full guide to giving yourself GCSF injections is covered in the document "Directions for Giving an Injection Below the Skin with Neupogen (Filgrastim) or Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) in a Pre-Filled Syringe" which is in the appendices. Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will talk you through this information as well.</p>

<p>Some patients will not give themselves injections of Neupogen or Neulasta (both types of GCSF), and will instead be given a different type of GCSF called Mozobil. If Mozobil is recommended for you then the injections will be given by a nurse in the BMT clinic.</p>

<p class="question invisible">How many injections, when are the GCSF injections given, by whom, where etc.</p>


<h4>Harvesting of your Stem Cells</h4>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: The harvesting/collection process. Patient connected to apheresis machine.</p></div>




<p class="question invisible">Where does mobilization/harvesting happen, when etc? I want to put this in the context of the Outpatient BMT process and give clear instructions.</p>


<p>The injections of GCSF into your body will stimulate the growth and mobilization of your stem cells. Now, they'll be harvested (also called "collected") from your body through a procedure called <em>apheresis</em>.</p>

<p>Apheresis is very similar to giving blood. You will lie in a chair or bed in the Blood Donor Room. An IV line will be put into a vein in your arm and a machine will separate the stem cells from your blood.</p>

<p>If your catheter has already been fitted then it might be used for harvesting instead of an IV line. In this case one of the lumens of your catheter will be connected to the machine that separates the stem cells from your blood.</p>

<p>Between 1 and 5 sessions will be needed to harvest enough stem cells, and each session will last 3 to 4 hours. Most patients experience no side effects from the harvesting process.</p>

<p>After your stem cells are harvested, they are frozen and stored until your transplant day.</p>

<h3>Receiving Your Chemotherapy</h3>

<ul>
<li>When does it happen: Day −2.</li>
</ul>


<p>Two days before your transplant you'll receive your chemotherapy. (This process is also called "conditioning" because it conditions, or prepares, your body for transplant). Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will work with you to schedule and explain your day of chemotherapy.</p>

<p>You'll be treated with a chemotherapy drug called Melphalan. Information about Melphalan, including its side effects, is included in the appendices.</p>

<p>This will be a busy day. Not only will you receive your chemotherapy, but you'll also meet your Clinical Pharmacist who will review your medications with you and show you how to use your pill box. You and your caregiver will also be given a lot of information about the rest of your treatment and what to expect - some of this information will be on paper and some of it will be verbal. Your caregiver might like to bring a notebook and pen to the clinic to note down key points and any questions.</p>

<h4>The Morning before Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>On the morning of Day −2 you and your caregiver should come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic at MSKCC's main campus at 8am. You should wear comfortable, loose everyday clothes - loose fitting tops or shirts that open to the front (so that we can access your catheter), comfortable pants (sweat pants or track suit). You can expect to be in the BMT Clinic for 6 to 10 hours, so you might want to bring newspapers, books, a laptop or tablet computer - things to pass the time.</p>

<p>Once you arrive at the BMT Outpatient Clinic You will be brought to your own private room. A nurse practitioner will review your medical history and ask you a set of questions about how you're feeling. Your vital signs will be checked and you will be weighed.</p>

<p>Once you have been fully evaluated you will meet with the Clinical Pharmacist. The Pharmacist will talk through the medications you will take throughout your treatment and will give you a full list of these medications.</p>

<p>Some of your medications will be "self-administered" in that you and your caregiver will manage them. You'll take your self-administered medications on a regular schedule or as needed. The Pharmacist will give you a a medication box (also called a pill box) that you'll use to store and manage your self-administered medications. The pharmacist will explain how to use and refill the pill box.</p>

<p class="question hidden">Could you walk me through what happens here in detail? They arrive, who do they meet, where do they go etc.</p>


<h4>Receiving Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>Once you have been evaluated and the Pharmacist has talked through your medications, you'll be brought to a nearby chemotherapy suite where you'll receive your chemotherapy. You are free to bring newspapers, books, your tablet or computer with you.</p>

<p>Before you receive your chemotherapy it goes through a number of safety checks to make sure everything is correct.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your chemotherapy is ordered by your doctor</li>
<li>A nurse checks your chemotherapy order</li>
<li>A pharmacist checks your chemotherapy order</li>
<li>A pharmacist checks your blood test results</li>
<li>Your chemotherapy is prepared in the Pharmacy</li>
<li>A pharmacist performs a comprehensive final check of your chemotherapy</li>
<li>Your chemotherapy is picked up by your chemotherapy nurse</li>
<li>2 chemotherapy nurses check to make sure your chemotherapy order, blood test results, and chemotherapy are correct</li>
</ul>


<p>Once all the safety checks have been complete the nurse will administer fluids (to keep you hydrated), anti-nausea medication and the chemotherapy drug through your catheter.</p>

<p class="question invisible">How long does this take? Can the caregiver remain with the patient?</p>


<h4>During your Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>Your chemotherapy will take several hours to administer, so you will be provided with meals.</p>

<p>During your chemotherapy your healthcare team will use this time to talk to you about the rest of your transplant journey.</p>

<p>The healthcare team will make sure that the logistics of the next few days are clear - what happens on transplant day and what happens after your transplant.</p>

<p>They'll talk to you about the side effects you'll start to experience after your chemotherapy. You'll be given printed materials that explain these side effects in detail and you'll be shown what to do if you need to get help while you are in your apartment/hotel.</p>

<p>You'll be introduced to the "Patient Temperature and Oral Intake Diary" that you and your caregiver will use to record your temperature and hydration every four hours while you are awake.</p>

<p>You and your caregiver should use the day of chemotherapy to ask as many questions as possible; make sure you are absolutely satisfied that you have all the information you need. Your healthcare team will do everything they can to answer your questions.</p>

<h4>After Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>When you finish chemotherapy you will return home to your apartment or hotel. You will rest for one day before your transplant.</p>

<p class="move invisible">Move this or rewrite: During this period your blood cell counts will be very low. You will be at high risk for infection until your bone marrow begins to make new blood cells. To reduce the risk, everyone who enters your room will follow special rules. Your doctor and nurse will explain these in detail.</p>


<h4>Side Effects of Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>Your chemotherapy will kill the cancerous cells in your body and will prepare your bone marrow to receive your transplant. However, the side effects associated with chemotherapy are not to be taken lightly. These side effects will include the loss of your ability to heal and fight infections, infertility, hair loss, fatigue, nausea, mouth sores and mouth tenderness.</p>

<p>Your healthcare team will help you understand and prepare for these side effects. Before you receive your chemotherapy make a list of questions that you would like to ask about these side effects. Talk through these questions with your caregiver and your healthcare team.</p>

<p class="question">What about peripheral neuropathy?</p>


<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Neutropenia and Low Platelet Level</h4>

<p>Your chemotherapy will severely damage your ability to fight infections and heal - it's important that you understand why this happens, how to watch for danger signs, and how to avoid infections and injuries.</p>

<p>One debilitating side effect of chemotherapy is called "<strong>neutropenia</strong>". Neutropenia is a condition where you have a a lower than normal number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in your bloodstream. Neutrophils play a crucial role in your immune system - they are one of the first types of cells that travel to the site of an infection. Once they reach the site of an infection they ingest and fight potentially harmful microorganisms.</p>

<p>Because your chemotherapy will kill your stem cells, you lose the ability to make new neutrophils. Because your neutrophils are not being replaced in your body, in the days after your chemotherapy the number of neutrophils in your bloodstream will drop to a very low level, leaving you vulnerable to infections. You and your caregiver will work together to watch for any sign of infection. You'll keep a regular record of your temperature and other vital signs, even when you are in your hotel or apartment and you will have to take very careful precautions to avoid infections.</p>

<p>As well as losing your ability to make neutrophils and other types of white blood cells, you'll also lose your ability to make <strong>platelets</strong>. Platelets are little fragments of larger cells made in your bone marrow; they break off from these larger cells and flow through your bloodstream - living for just a few days before being replaced. They clump together to help stop bleeding. Because you will have a very low platelet count after your chemotherapy you will take special care to avoid cuts and strenuous activities that might cause bleeding. You'll take special care of your gums and mouth, because it's quite common for bleeding to start here.</p>

<p>After your transplant your healthcare team will regularly take samples of your blood to count the number of neutrophils and platelets in your bloodstream.</p>

<p>As your stem cells take hold and start to make new blood cells the number of neutrophils in your bloodstream (sometimes referred to as your Absolute Neutrophil Count or ANC) will increase, as will your number of platelets (called your platelet count) - these are collectively known as "your counts" and they are key signs that your transplant has worked. You'll hear the term "counts" used frequently by your healthcare team.</p>

<p>More in-depth guides to living with neutropenia and low platelet levels are included later in this guide under Phase 3: After Your Transplant.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Infertility</h4>

<p>Chemotherapy drugs that kill rapidly-dividing cancer cells will also affect you fertility. It's highly likely that your chemotherapy will mean that you will not be able to conceive a child naturally - if you would like to have children in the future you can make arrangements to have your sperm or eggs frozen before your chemotherapy. Collecting and freezing sperm before your chemotherapy will enable you and your partner to attempt pregnancy when you are ready.</p>

<p>The first step is to schedule an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist. Reproductive endocrinologists are doctors with special training in fertility and reproductive health. The reproductive endocrinologist will evaluate your fertility and will give you advice on how best to proceed.</p>

<p>It's also very important that you speak to your insurance company. They will tell you if the costs associated with infertility treatment are covered under your policy. Even if your insurance does not cover infertility there may be other  programs or grants that can help you pay for your infertility treatment. These are described in the Fertility and Cancer Treatment guides which are included in the appendices.</p>

<p>Typically <strong>men</strong> who want to have children after their chemotherapy opt to have their sperm collected and frozen, this is called sperm banking.</p>

<p>If you are a man and wish to donate sperm you will travel to a sperm bank facility between one and three times. At the sperm bank you will ejaculate into a cup. The sperm bank will analyze the semen, counting the number of sperm. They will also study the shape of your sperm and their motility (ability to swim). If the sperm look healthy, the sperm bank will divide the specimen into small vials and freeze and store them.</p>

<p>Sperm can be stored for as long as is necessary and a yearly storage fee will apply.</p>

<p><strong>Women</strong> who want to have children after their chemotherapy can have eggs or fertilized embryos collected and stored beforehand.</p>

<p>If you are a woman and wish to store your eggs or embryos for future fertilization, first the reproductive endocrinologist will examine you and review your medical history before discussing your options.</p>

<p>If banking your eggs or embryos is an option and you decide to proceed on or around the first day of your period you will start giving yourself daily hormone injections. This medicine will stimulate your ovaries to make more eggs than usual. You will continue this for one to two weeks.</p>

<p>While you are taking the daily injections, you will see your reproductive endocrinologist every day or every other day for blood tests and transvaginal ultrasounds.</p>

<p>Once you have enough mature eggs, you will give yourself a different injection to stimulate ovulation. Within 36 hours you will have an egg retrieval. The egg retrieval is an outpatient procedure done using anesthesia - you will be asleep and no surgical incision is needed. The eggs are collected using a very thin needle that is passed through your vagina.</p>

<p>From this point it's possible to fertilize your eggs with sperm and freeze the resulting embryos. This is called embryo cryopreservation.</p>

<p>An alternative to embryo cryopreservation is egg (oocyte) cryopreservation. This involves freezing eggs that have not been fertilized. When you are ready to use them, the eggs are thawed and fertilized with sperm. This is a newer technology and is still considered experimental but may be preferred by women who do not have a male partner during this time.</p>

<p>Whether you decide to freeze embryos or eggs, they will be stored at an egg bank until you are ready and you have been medically cleared to start a family. A yearly storage fee will apply.</p>

<p>For more detailed information about infertility associated with cancer treatment and your options you should consult the Fertility and Cancer Treatment guides included in the appendices. These guides also list reproductive endocrinologists in the area. You should also talk with your bone marrow transplant doctor about options to preserve your fertility.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Hair Loss</h4>

<p>The chemotherapy that kills your rapidly-dividing cancer cells also kills the rapidly-dividing cells that produce your hair. Most patients will lose their hair during their transplant.</p>

<p>Losing your hair can be an unpleasant, upsetting experience. Like many patients, you might choose to cut your hair short before your transplant to take control of this process and to lessen the shock of losing your hair. Talk this through with your caregiver, friends and family.</p>

<p>Before your transplant is also a good time to think about whether you would like to wear a wig. Modern wigs can look very natural and wearing one might make you feel more comfortable. There are many wig stores in New York, a list of them is provided in the appendices. You can one while you still have your hair, or with a clipping of your hair, if you'd like your wig to match your natural hair.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Fatigue</h4>

<p>After your chemotherapy the number of red blood cells (RBCs) in your blood will be very low.</p>

<p>Red blood cells are the cells that transport oxygen around your body. Because the number of red blood cells in your blood will be low, oxygen will not travel around your body as easily as before. This will mean that you will feel tired. Your caregiver will need to help you carry out day to day activities until your red blood cell count returns to normal. Don't be afraid to ask for help, even with things you used to do with ease.</p>

<p>Even though you will feel tired after your chemotherapy and your transplant, you should still try to remain active - we have recommended some exercises and activities that you can do in section three.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Nausea</h4>

<p class="outstanding">To be written</p>


<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - The Importance of Communication</h4>

<p>Throughout your treatment it's very important that you communicate clearly with your healthcare team and your caregiver about your side effects.</p>

<p>Tell your healthcare team how you're feeling. Describe how your body feels. Describe how you're doing emotionally. Tell them if anything is worrying you. If you notice changes in how you feel describe what has changed. If anything bothers you, even if it seems minor, tell your healthcare team. The more information you can communicate to your healthcare team the more they'll be able to help you. There is usually something that they can do to make you feel more comfortable.</p>

<h3>Rest Day</h3>

<p>The day after you receive your chemotherapy is a rest day. This rest day allows the chemotherapy drug to work and then leave your body. When you receive your stem cells there will be no trace of the chemotherapy drug in your body, so the transplanted stem cells will not be harmed.</p>

<h4>Monitoring Temperature and Fluid Intake</h4>

<p>From now on your caregiver must take your temperature every four hours and write it in the "Temperature and Oral Intake Diary".</p>

<p class="question">Where does the caregiver get the thermometer from?</p>


<p>If your temperature is 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher your caregiver needs follow the instructions on your BMT Emergency Guide; if it is between 8am and 8pm call the BMT Outpatient Clinic at (212) 639-2399. If it is after 8pm call (212) 639-2000 and ask for the doctor covering bone marrow transplant.</p>

<p>It's really important that you drink a lot of fluids from now on. As well as taking your temperature your caregiver will also monitor all of the fluids you drink and record the volume you drink in the Intake Diary. You should drink 2 liters or 64 fluid ounces of fluids each day. Try to drink steadily throughout the day; little and often.</p>

<p>Your caregiver should bring the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary to the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day. A nurse practitioner will review the diary with you.</p>

<p class="question invisible">Do we need to describe what should happen on the rest day? Has the caregiver already been monitoring the patient's vitals and fluid intake, or is this the first day?</p>


<h3>Other Things to Consider in Phase 1</h3>

<p class="outstanding">Need to bring the childcare, pets, exercise, emotional support in here. Need input from the Social Work team; this is pending. They are aware that I need content.</p>


<h3>Checklist</h3>

<p>Before your outpatient treatment starts, there are a number of arrangements to make and options to consider. Use this checklist to keep track of things you need to do before your transplant.</p>

<h2>Phase 2 - Your Transplant</h2>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Diagram of the transplant process/timeline with a "you are here" marker on Phase Two, or highlighting of some kind.</p></div>


<h3>One Page Summary of This Phase</h3>

<p>Phase 2 of your treatment last just one day. On Day 0, your transplant day, your stem cells will be taken from storage and infused into your body through your catheter.</p>

<p>These are the key things that will happen during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stem Cells Retrieved - Your stem cells will be taken from storage and thawed.</li>
<li>Transplantation - Your stem cells will be infused into your body through your catheter.</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these activities in detail later in this section.</p>

<h4>Topics</h4>

<p>It's also important that you know about these topics during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Topic 1</li>
<li>Topic 2</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these topics in detail later in this section.</p>

<p class="question invisible">It probably makes more sense to speak about living with neutropenia, monitoring symptoms, infection control in phase three. This is such a short phase that there may be no other topics worth adding into this section. TBD. </p>


<h4>Actions - Things You Need to Do</h4>

<p>At the end of this chapter you'll find a list of things we need you to do during this phase of your treatment. Read this section in full then start to work your way through this list of actions.</p>

<h3>Transplant Day</h3>

<p>Now that you've received chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells in your body, it's time for your transplant. The stem cells that were separated from your blood and frozen earlier will be re-infused into your body. These stem cells will give you back your ability to make new blood and fight infections.</p>

<h4>The Morning Before Transplant</h4>

<p>On the morning of Day 0, your transplant day, you and your caregiver should come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic at MSKCC's main campus at 8am. Give yourself extra time to get to the clinic, as you may feel tired after your chemotherapy. Bring newspapers, books, a laptop or tablet computer to pass the time.</p>

<p>Once you arrive at the BMT Outpatient Clinic a nurse practitioner will review ask you a set of questions and review your  Patient Temperature and Oral Intake Diary. You will be brought to a private room for a physical exam and your vital signs will be checked.</p>

<p class="question invisible">I'd like to get a clear picture of what exactly happens when the patient gets to the clinic. </p>


<h4>The Transplant</h4>

<p>Before your transplant, your frozen stem cells will be removed from storage at our blood bank and brought to your room. The stem cells are stored in clear plastic bags that look like a bag of blood. The bags will be placed in a warm water bath to thaw.</p>

<p>Once the stem cells are thawed, the nurse practitioner or doctor will infuse the stem cells into your body through your catheter.</p>

<p class="question">How long does the transplant (the infusion of the stem cells) take from start to finish?</p>


<p>You may have experience some side effects as the stem cells are given to you through your catheter. The common ones are nausea, vomiting, a tickle in your throat, or a cough. You will be given some medicine about 30 minutes before your transplant to help reduce these side effects. It's important that you communicate with the healthcare team and with your caregiver during your transplant; let them know how you're feeling especially if something doesn't feel right.</p>

<p>During and after your transplant you may notice a strong, garlic-like taste in your mouth. Your urine, sweat, and skin may also have a garlic-like smell. This is caused by the preservative used to store your stem cells. The small will gradually go away over 1 to 2 days.</p>

<p class="question">I just want to validate that the small could be present during *and* after the transplant. Also, when it's mentioned that "The Nutrition Department will provide lemons" - how is it envisaged that the lemons are used. Cut them, leave them around? Why lemons, because they're natural, non-chemical, non-toxic?</p>


<p>Almost immediately after your stem cells are infused into your body they will travel through your bloodstream into your bone marrow.</p>

<p>Once the stem cells arrive in your bone marrow they begin to "engraft", forming bonds with surrounding tissues and becoming fixed in place. They'll begin to divide and differentiate, creating more stem cells and making the different components of your blood including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.</p>

<h4>After Your Transplant</h4>

<p class="question invisible">What happens directly after the transplant? I'd like to travel with the patient from the room where they receive their transplant to their hotel/apartment.</p>


<p>After your stem cells are infused through your catheter you will remain in your hospital room for 2-3 hours for observation. After that you will be allowed to return home to your hotel or apartment to rest.</p>

<h3>Other Things to Consider in Phase 2</h3>

<p class="question">I don't believe there are any in-depth topics to add in here. Probably best to talk about living with neutropenia, low platelet count, diet etc. in the next phase. Happy to add supplementary information to the transplant here though - suggestions welcome. </p>


<h3>Checklist</h3>

<p class="outstanding">This will be a checkable list - circles where the patient and the caregiver can check-off items. We need to validate this list and add anything else we think is relevant.</p>


<h2>Phase 3 - After Your Transplant</h2>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Diagram of the transplant process/timeline with a "you are here" marker on Phase Three, or highlighting of some kind.</p></div>


<h3>One Page Summary of This Phase</h3>

<p>Now that you've had your transplant, you enter a period of watching and waiting for engraftment to occur. As engraftment occurs the number of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets in your blood will return to normal - the amount of these cells, called your "counts", will be monitored daily.</p>

<p>After your transplant you will remain in a nearby apartment or hotel and will return to the BMT Clinic each day to have your progress evaluated and to have adjustments made to your treatment.</p>

<p>These are the key things that will happen during this phase:</p>

<p class="outstanding">To be written</p>


<p>We cover each of these activities in detail later in this section.</p>

<h4>Topics</h4>

<p>It's also important that you know about these topics during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Topic 1</li>
<li>Topic 2</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these topics in detail later in this section.</p>

<h4>Actions - Things You Need to Do</h4>

<p>At the end of this chapter you'll find a list of things we need you to do during this phase of your treatment. Read this section in full then start to work your way through this list of actions.</p>

<h3>Maintaining the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary</h3>

<p>After your transplant your caregiver must continue to take your temperature every four hours and write it in the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary.</p>

<p>If your temperature is 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher your caregiver needs follow the instructions on your BMT Emergency Guide. Your caregiver will also monitor all of the fluids you drink and record the volume you drink in the Intake Diary. You should drink 2 liters or 64 fluid ounces of fluids each day. Try to drink steadily throughout the day; little and often.</p>

<p>Your caregiver should bring the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary to the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day. A nurse practitioner will review the diary with you.</p>

<h3>Your Daily Visit to the BMT Clinic</h3>

<p>Each morning you will return to the Outpatient BMT Clinic. You should arrive at 8am. You will remain at the clinic for most of the day.  Bring newspapers, books, a laptop or tablet computer or other things to pass the time.</p>

<p>When you come to the clinic you should wear every-day, comfortable clothing that allows for easy access to your catheter; shirts that open at the front, sweatshirts, large t-shirts. Nothing that is too difficult to take off or put back on again.</p>

<p>You should bring these items to the clinic with you each day:</p>

<ul>
<li>A list of all prescription and non-prescription medications you are taking with dosages and frequency. This should include vitamins, nutritional supplements, herbal products and over-the-counter drugs.</li>
<li>All the prescription medications you were instructed to take during the bone marrow transplant period.</li>
<li>Your temperature and oral intake record</li>
</ul>


<p>Once you arrive you will check-in. A nurse practitioner will sit with you and your caregiver and you'll be asked a series of questions about how you feel. The nurse practitioner will check the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary.</p>

<p>Once you've checked in, you'll be brought to an examination room where you'll be examined physically and your vital signs will be checked.</p>

<p>Some of your blood will be taken and sent for testing. Your blood will be checked to see how your white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets are recovering. Your blood will also be checked for any signs of infection such as the presence of harmful bacteria or viruses.</p>

<p class="question">Any details we can add here would be great. What happens during clinic visits. If you can bullet I can write up.</p>


<p>Once you've been examined you will wait in the Outpatient BMT Clinic for your test results to return. This can take several hours. This is a good time for your caregiver to take a break; he or she can take some personal time or run errands. You will be safe in the care of the Outpatient BMT team. We highly recommend that caregivers leave the hospital and take this time to unwind.</p>

<p>After several hours, your test results (sometimes referred to as "labs") will come back from the lab. Your healthcare team will analyze the results and will make decisions about your care.  The rest of your visit to the Outpatient BMT Clinic that day will depend on the results of your tests.</p>

<p>Here are some things that can happen based on the results of your tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>You could be given fluids to hydrate you</li>
<li>You could be given an infusion of platelets, red blood cells or other blood components</li>
<li>Your medication could be changed</li>
<li>Your treatment could be left as-is</li>
</ul>


<p>All of this will be explained to you. You'll remain in the clinic until any actions the healthcare team have recommended have been completed. Once your healthcare team is happy, you'll be free to leave. You'll return to your apartment or hotel where your caregiver will continue to monitor your temperature and fluid intake.</p>

<p>You'll continue to make daily visits to the clinic until your healthcare team decide that you can come less regularly.</p>

<h3>Living with Neutropenia</h3>

<p>As you know, your chemotherapy will kill not only the cancerous cells in your body, but also healthy stem cells that make the different types of cells in your blood. This is why you received a transplant.</p>

<p>Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, play a crucial role in your immune system. In the days and weeks after your transplant, while your transplanted stem cells are still engrafting, you will have a very low number of neutrophils in your bloodstream. This will leave you highly susceptible to infections.</p>

<p>You and your caregiver will take careful precautions to avoid infections while you are "neutropenic". These precautions will include eating a special, low-microbial diet (a diet that contains a low number of potentially harmful microorganisms), washing carefully, taking care of your mouth and other precautions.</p>

<h4>Avoiding Sources of Infection</h4>

<p>One of the best ways to avoid infection is to simply avoid sources of infection. This is easier said than done - you and your caregiver will need to be careful about seeing visitors, what you touch, where you go. While you are neutropenic you should try to avoid:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shaking hands with people. When you do shake hands with people use an antibacterial gel, such as Purell&reg; afterwards</li>
<li>Contact with young children, including your children if they are under 12</li>
<li>Contact with animals, including your pets - they cannot stay with you during your transplant</li>
<li>Contact with soil or dirt - you should not keep any plants in your hotel or apartment and should not accept gifts of flowers or plants</li>
<li>Contact with people who have had colds or recent illnesses</li>
</ul>


<p>Telling people who love you and want to make sure that you're okay that you can't see them can be difficult, but you and your caregiver need to be vigilant. You can explain to them that it's just for a short period of time, and that by taking these precautions you are making sure that you can see them as soon as possible. They will understand.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you use a computer or tablet and programs like Skype, Google Talk/Hangouts, FaceTime to keep in touch with friends and family when you are neutropenic.</p>

<h4>Connecting with Children</h4>

<p>Children under 12 are not able to visit you during your transplant period because of the risk of infection. This separation will be difficult for you, your child, and the rest of your family. We know from past experience that patients with children experience a range of feelings and reactions related to this separation.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you take time to talk to one of the social workers about being separated from your children. You or your caregiver should ask your doctor, BMT Nurse Coordinator or any member of the healthcare team that you'd like to speak with one of the social workers and they will make sure to come and see you.</p>

<p>Here are some things that other patients have done to remain in contact with their children during their transplant.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a computer or tablet and programs like Skype, Google Talk/Hangouts, FaceTime to talk to your children regularly. Set up a time that you talk to them each day - like when they get home from school and before they go to bed. Get into a routine of using the computer to see them and talk to them.</li>
<li>Paint or create other crafts to send home. Craft supplies can be provided to you by the Patient Recreation Center. Ask one of your healthcare team to arrange for the Patient Recreation Center to bring supplies to you.</li>
<li>Use your phone to make an audio recording of yourself as you read your children's favorite stories. Upload these recordings to the web, give them to your caregiver, or e-mail them to your children. They can read along with these stories while listening to your voice.</li>
<li>Keep copies of your children's favorite stories with you in your apartment or hotel. At night you can use Skype to read along with them before they go to sleep.</li>
<li>Ask your children to decorate your apartment or hotel with pictures; your caregiver can bring them to you and you can show them hanging on the wall to your children over Skype.</li>
<li>Give your child a special coloring book or journal for times when they miss you are feelings are difficult. Your caregiver can bring the colorings to you. You can talk to your child about them over Skype or the phone.</li>
</ul>


<p>We understand that nothing will replace physical contact between you and your children, but we strongly encourage you to use all available technology and means at your disposal to maintain a strong bond with them while you are unable to see them due to your neutropenia.</p>

<h4>Showering and Bathing</h4>

<p>While you are neutropenic you keeping yourself clean is very important.</p>

<p>You should shower or bathe daily. When you shower or bathe you should use soap that can kill germs. Look for the words "antibacterial" or "antimicrobial". Dial&reg; is one example, but there are many others.</p>

<p>When you shower or bathe take extra care to make sure you wash yourself thoroughly. Begin with your upper body, then the middle section, and wash the lower area including your feet last. Wash carefully under your arms, in your anal and genital areas, and in any skin folds. Germs tend to live in these moist areas. You may shampoo your scalp with soap once a day.</p>

<p>After you urinate or move your bowels, wash your buttocks and genital area with antibacterial soap. You can also use moist wipes. Pat the area dry. Wash your hands well afterward.</p>

<p>When you wash or bathe take care of your catheter; detailed instructions on how to protect your catheter against water are in the appendices.</p>

<p class="question">Can the person use a razor or must they use an electric razor/shaver? Can the person use tampons - there's a general lack of information about what women do during their period. If you can bullet-point the key points I can write up.</p>


<h4>Mouth Care</h4>

<p>While you're neutropenic and have a low platelet count you will need to change the way you brush your teeth and care for your mouth. This will help to avoid infection and bleeding.</p>

<p>Follow these guidelines to take good care of your mouth:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will be given a mouthwash to rinse your mouth before and after meals and at bedtime. The number of rinses may be increased to every 2 hours, depending on how your mouth feels.</li>
<li>Use only the mouthwash that your nurse gives you. Do not use mouthwash or toothpaste from any store. These products irritate and dry the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat.</li>
<li>Use an ultra soft toothbrush. You may also use Toothettes&reg; disposable foam sticks.</li>
<li>Do not use dental floss.</li>
<li>Avoid licking your lips. It increases drying and chapping.</li>
<li>Apply a lubricant like Chapstick &reg; after you clean or rinse your mouth and every 2 to 4 hours as needed. This will help keep your lips moist.</li>
<li>To avoid an infection in your mouth, the doctor will prescribe an oral anti-fungal antibiotic.</li>
<li>If your mouth becomes sensitive, avoid hot, spicy, acidic, or coarse foods. You may prefer soft or liquid food served chilled or at room temperature.</li>
<li>If your mouth feels very painful, your doctor will prescribe medicine for the pain.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Eating a Low-Microbial Diet</h4>

<p>After your chemotherapy, and until told otherwise by your healthcare team, you will need to eat what is called a low-microbial diet. A low microbial diet is a diet that contains fewer microbes (also called microorganisms) than would ordinarily be found in every-day foods. Microbes are tiny living organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, yeast, and molds.</p>

<p>Microbes can attach to foods and grow, but you can't always see, smell, or taste them. They are more likely to grow on milk, unrefrigerated food, undercooked foods, certain fruits and vegetables, unpasteurized juices and vegetable sprouts - but in reality they can grow on any food.</p>

<p>Eating a diet that contains fewer microbes will help you getting sick.</p>

<p>You will need to take careful precautions with the food you eat, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buying foods that you know have been stored properly and are safe to eat</li>
<li>Storing food safely in your hotel or apartment</li>
<li>Keeping your kitchen very clean</li>
<li>Keeping your refrigerator clean</li>
<li>Handling food safely</li>
<li>Eating only food that you know has been prepared and cooked in keeping with a low-microbial diet</li>
<li>Cooking foods thoroughly</li>
</ul>


<p>A full guide to eating a low-microbial diet and these topics is included in the appendices of this document.</p>

<h3>Living with a Low Platelet Count</h3>

<p>Platelets are little fragments of larger cells made in your bone marrow; they break off from these larger cells and flow through your bloodstream. They clump together to help stop bleeding. Because you will have a very low platelet count after your chemotherapy you and your caregiver will take special precautions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid sharp objects such as a razors, scissors, and nail clippers. You should only shave using an electric razor/shaver and not a razor that has a blade</li>
<li>Do not have manicures, pedicures, waxes, electrolysis or tattoos</li>
<li>Do not have any dental work done</li>
<li>Follow the guidelines on mouth care (above)</li>
<li>Do not use rectal suppositories, enemas, or tampons</li>
<li>Do not take your temperature rectally</li>
<li>Consider using stool softeners or laxatives if you are straining to have bowel movements</li>
<li>Avoid tight clothing or any clothing that you have to strain to put on or take off</li>
</ul>


<p>You should avoid any activity that may result in injury. This includes any:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contact sports</li>
<li>Climbing ladders</li>
<li>Strenuous exercise</li>
<li>Bicycling</li>
<li>Weight lifting</li>
</ul>


<p>You should take precautions when you are having sex. You should use lubrication if needed and avoid anal or oral intercourse. Avoid strong thrusting as this can cause bleeding.</p>

<p class="question">Are these guidelines correct? I had thought that barrier method contraception had to be used as well for BMT patients. These are the generic low platelet guidelines and as such might not cover auto BMT.</p>


<p>You should avoid medications that have not been explicitly prescribed to you by your medical team. Do not take:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aspirin or products that contain aspirin</li>
<li>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Advil&reg;</li>
<li>Vitamin E</li>
</ul>


<p>All of these drugs make it more difficult for your blood to clot and so are very dangerous for somebody like you with a limited ability to heal and clot.</p>

<p>Call your doctor if you develop any symptoms of bleeding. Be on the lookout for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Excessive bruising</li>
<li>A faint red rash on your trunk, arms or legs</li>
<li>Vaginal spotting or heavy menstrual bleeding</li>
<li>The appearance of broken blood vessels in the white of your eye</li>
</ul>


<p>If you notice that you are bleeding you should take these steps immediately:</p>

<ol>
<li>Apply direct pressure on the bleeding site.</li>
<li>After applying pressure, follow the BMT Emergency Guide; if it is between 8am and 8pm call the BMT Outpatient Clinic at (212) 639-2399. If it is after 8pm call (212) 639-2000 and ask for the doctor covering bone marrow transplant.</li>
<li>Apply ice over the bridge of your nose for nosebleeds.</li>
</ol>


<p>Call your doctor immediately if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have black bowel movements, blood in the stool, or rectal bleeding</li>
<li>Have blood in your urine</li>
<li>Have a headache that do not get better, blurred vision, or dizziness</li>
<li>Cough up blood, vomit blood or get a nose bleeds</li>
</ul>
