<h2>Bone Marrow Basics</h2>

<h3>What is Bone Marrow, What Are Stem Cells?</h3>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: We should draw a diagram of this process; marrow->stem cells->differentiated cells. The stock ones available online are not good and we can do better.</p></div>


<p>Bone marrow is a substance found in the spaces in the center of the larger bones in your body; your hip, breastbone and pelvis.</p>

<p>Your bone marrow is where the different types of blood cells are made - including the white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that carry oxygen and and platelets that clot to stop you bleeding.</p>

<p>But, you might ask, how are these blood cells "made"?</p>

<p>Bone marrow contains a large number of what are called stem cells. Stem cells are young blood cells; they can create many copies of themselves - <em>dividing</em> again and again to create more stem cells.</p>

<p>Your stem cells can also follow a path called <em>differentiation</em>, where they change into the different types of blood cells found in your body.</p>

<p>Stem cells are constantly dividing and differentiating in our bone marrow creating new blood cells to replace older cells.</p>

<h3>Why You Need a Transplant</h3>

<p>You have malfunctioning, cancerous cells in your body - and these cells are diving rapidly. Your type of cancer responds to high doses of chemotherapy, a form of cancer treatment that uses chemicals to kill these rapidly dividing cells.</p>

<p>One drawback of chemotherapy is that it also kills other types of rapidly dividing cells in your body - including the stem cells that produce your blood.</p>

<p>When you receive chemotherapy to kill the cancerous cells in your body your bone marrow will be wiped out and you will lose the ability to make new blood cells.</p>

<p>Because you can't make new blood cells, your immune system and your body's ability to renew itself are compromised.</p>

<p>This is why you need a transplant.</p>

<h3>What is an Autologous Transplant?</h3>

<p>Autologous means <em>from yourself</em> - an autologous bone marrow transplant, also called an autologous <em>stem cell</em> transplant, is one where stem cells are collected (also called "harvested") from your body before you receive your chemotherapy. These stem cells are stored safely while you receive your chemotherapy, then given back to you. You are literally receiving a transplant from yourself.</p>

<p>An autologous transplant has three key phases:</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of the process of harvesting/collection. Apheresis. </p></div>


<p><strong>Before</strong> - You prepare for your transplant. You are fitted with a catheter. You receive drugs that stimulate your body to make more stem cells than normal. Your stem cells are harvested from your body and stored. You receive your chemotherapy, called the "conditioning regimen", to kill cancer cells. Your stem cells are also killed and you lose your ability to make new blood cells.</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of chemotherapy being given through the catheter. </p></div>


<p><strong>During</strong> - You have lost your ability to make new blood, so your immune and healing systems are compromised. Your stem cells are taken from storage and re-infused back into your body.</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of the process of engraftment. </p></div>


<p><strong>After</strong> - The re-infused stem cells find their way through your bloodstream to your bones. Over time they take hold in your bones, a process called "engraftment". They begin to divide and create healthy, new blood cells. Your immune and vital systems begin to return.</p>

<p>Each patient's journey is a little different; your medical team will be able to explain your transplant in more detail.</p>

<h3>What is an Outpatient Bone Marrow Transplant?</h3>

<p>Until relatively recently, bone marrow transplants were always done on an inpatient basis; you would live in the hospital during your chemotherapy, transplant and some of your recovery period.</p>

<p>Now, bone marrow transplants like yours can be done on an outpatient basis. This means that while you are receiving your treatment, you will stay in a local hotel or apartment. Every day you will come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic for blood work, vital signs, weight and physical examination. You will only be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay if you develop complications.</p>

<p>Here is a typical timeline for an outpatient transplant:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Day −4:</em> You and your caregiver check into a hotel or apartment close to MSKCC's main campus in Manhattan.</li>
<li><em>Day −3:</em> You and your caregiver come to MSKCC's Interventional Radiology department at main campus where you are fitted with a central venous catheter. You return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.</li>
<li><em>Day −2:</em> You come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic where you receive your chemotherapy. You return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.</li>
<li><em>Day −1:</em> This is a rest day; you remain in your hotel or apartment for the day.</li>
<li><em>Day 0:</em> Transplant day. You come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic where you receive your stem cell transplant. You return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.</li>
<li><em>Day +1 to +12:</em> You will visit the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day to have blood work done, your vital signs checked and a physical examination. You'll also receive hydration, electrolytes and transfusions if necessary. You return to your hotel or apartment every evening.</li>
</ul>


<p>After <em>Day +12</em> your central venous catheter will be removed. If you live within one hour of MSKCC's main campus you can return home. If you live further away you will stay at your local hotel or apartment for an additional two weeks. You will visit the Outpatient BMT Clinic twice a week, instead of every day.</p>

<p>You'll see that the days leading up to your transplant are given minus number; Day −3, Day −2 etc. The day of your transplant is Day 0, and the days that follow are Day +1, Day +2 etc. Your healthcare team will use this format when they explain your transplant to you.</p>

<p class="move">Move: While you are in the outpatient clinic you will be cared for in a private room that has a bed and bathroom. A light breakfast and lunch will be provided for you. There is a communal lounge with coffee and tea for caregivers.</p>


<h2>Your Transplant Team</h2>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Photograph of the outpatient transplant team would work, if printing is not an issue.</p></div>


<p>A team of healthcare professionals from the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service will care for you.</p>

<p>Your <em>attending doctor</em> will be in charge of your care throughout your treatment. Fellows, nurse practitioners, hospitalists and house staff are also partners in your care. <em>Should we give the names of some attending doctors?</em></p>

<p>A <em>fellow</em> is a doctor who has completed general training and is receiving additional training in cancer care.</p>

<p>A <em>nurse practitioner</em> is a nurse who has a master's or doctoral degree. The nurse practitioner is licensed to examine you, provide medical treatments and prescribe medications.</p>

<p>Your <em>BMT Nurse Coordinator</em> will work with you and your team of doctors to organize all the testing, procedures and consults with other professionals required prior to your transplant.  This nurse will also provide you with treatment calendars describing the timeline for your plan of care and education about the pre-transplant process</p>

<p>The <em>hospitalist</em> is a doctor who only sees patients while they are in the hospital. At MSKCC a hospitalist is on duty all night.</p>

<p><em>House staff</em> are doctors who are completing their residency. They work under the supervision of the fellows and attending doctors.</p>

<p>A team of <em>nurses</em> will provide your day-to-day nursing care.</p>

<p>A <em>Clinical Pharmacist</em> who specializes in the care of transplant patients will review your medications with you and your caregiver, teaching you how to take them properly and to inform you of any side effects they may cause. The pharmacist will review your medications daily with the outpatient team.</p>

<p><em>Social Workers</em> are members of the healthcare team who will help you and your family manage the stresses that come with the transplant process. The social workers understand the issues faced by transplant patients and are on hand to listen, offer counseling and refer you or your family to other resources and services as needed.</p>

<p class="question invisible">What about the BMT Nurse Coordinator or the Transplant Coordinator?</p>


<p>While you are here, you will come to know all of the members of your team.</p>

<p class="question hidden"><span class="complete">Would it be useful to mention other support services here, PT, OT, Social Work? If we mention them, do we refer to them as the healthcare team, or as support services?</span> Decision: Yes, include social work and pharmacist - but not PT/OT</p>


<h2>Phase 1 - Before Your Transplant</h2>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Diagram of the transplant process/timeline with a "you are here" marker on Phase one, or highlighting of some kind.</p></div>


<p>Phase 1 of your treatment begins when you meet your Outpatient BMT team on or around Day −30 and runs all the way up to Day −1, a rest day following your chemotherapy.</p>

<h3>One Page Summary of This Phase</h3>

<p>In this phase you'll make preparations for your transplant; practically, physically and emotionally. This will be a very busy time for you and your family.</p>

<p>These are the key things that will happen during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Financial Clearance - You will work with your insurance company to make sure your treatment and medications are covered</li>
<li>Meeting your Team - You will meet your primary physician and members of the Outpatient BMT team</li>
<li>Choosing a Caregiver - You'll identify a family member or friend to act as your caregiver</li>
<li>Orientation - You and your caregiver will attend an orientation meeting</li>
<li>Side Effects - You will make decisions about your fertility, about wearing a wig and other issues related to the side effects of chemotherapy</li>
<li>Testing - You'll undergo a round of tests</li>
<li>Lodging - You'll move into a hotel or apartment near to MSKCC.</li>
<li>Catheter - Your central venous catheter will be fitted</li>
<li>Harvesting - Your stem cells will be collected and stored</li>
<li>Chemotherapy - You will receive high dose chemotherapy</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these activities in detail later in this section.</p>

<h4>Topics</h4>

<p>It's also important that you know about these topics during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Acknowledging and managing your <em>emotions</em></li>
<li><em>Remaining active</em> during your transplant and recovery</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these topics in detail later in this section.</p>

<p class="move">From the list of topics, move: What you can and cannot eat during transplant and recovery</p>


<h4>Actions - Things You Need to Do</h4>

<p>At the end of this chapter you'll find a list of things we need you to do during this phase of your treatment. Read this section in full then start to work your way through this list of actions.</p>

<p class="question hidden"><span class="complete">Should this be included at the end of each chapter?</span> Decision: Yes, actions at the end of the chapter.</p>


<h3>Meeting Your Team</h3>

<p>When does it happen: Around Day −30.</p>

<p class="outstanding">To be written</p>


<h3>Choosing Your Caregiver</h3>

<p>One of the most important steps as you prepare for your transplant is choosing your caregiver. This person is usually a family member or a close friend and will be an important part of your healthcare team.</p>

<p class="question invisible"><span class="complete">I would like to write this bullet-point list into more fluid text, is that acceptable?</span> Decision: Yes, re-write.</p>


<p>While you're undergoing your transplant your caregiver will not be able to work. Your caregiver will need to remain with you for most of the day and night - though while you are in the Outpatient BMT clinic your caregiver can take some time for themselves; this is something we strongly recommend.</p>

<h4>Choosing the Right Caregiver</h4>

<p>Take time now to think about who you would like to be your caregiver. It should be somebody you trust who can take the time to care for you and who can offer you the support you need. Choose somebody you're comfortable communicating with and who can offer you the emotional support you need.</p>

<h3>BMT Orientation</h3>

<p class="question">To be written. I don't understand how the BMT Orientation works; research and write content. Does the face-to-face BMT orientation still happen?</p>


<h4>Resources for Caregivers</h4>

<p class="move">Need to check what this means: "There are many resources available at MSKCC for patients and caregivers. You can learn about them in the Resources section of this guide or by talking with your team."</p>


<h3>Financial Clearance</h3>

<h4>Insurance</h4>

<p class="outstanding">Summarize insurance issues, what the patient needs to do to get clearance. The role of Patient Financial Services. </p>


<h4>Financial Support</h4>

<p class="outstanding">Sources of financial assistance available to patients. What these grants cover, what they don't cover. How to apply. Social work team are going to offer relevant content. </p>


<h3>Pre-Transplant Medical Testing</h3>

<p>Before you receive your chemotherapy or undergo your transplant you will have some tests that will give us a good understanding of your baseline health and organ function. These tests will be done in the 30 days before your transplant (Day −30 onwards). The BMT Nurse Coordinator will work with you and your caregiver to schedule the tests.</p>

<p>It's likely that you'll receive these tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>A chest x-ray - done to ensure your lungs are clear and there is no evidence of a pneumonia or other problems</li>
<li>Blood tests - done to evaluate your baseline kidney and liver function, and to assess your white blood cell, hemoglobin and platelet counts</li>
<li>Urine tests</li>
<li>Electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (ECHO) or other tests that give information about your heart</li>
<li>Pulmonary function tests (PFT's) - breathing tests that measure lung function</li>
<li>Computerized axial tomography (CT) Scan - an x-ray that provides cross-sectional views and images of soft tissue as well as bone. It also provides measurements of your chest and is used to plan your radiation treatments.</li>
<li>Positron emission tomography (PET) Scan – a scan used to visualize physiologic function in body areas</li>
<li>Bone marrow aspiration - provides a sample of your bone marrow</li>
<li>Skeletal survey - An x-ray of the major bones in your body. This can take a few hours to do.</li>
</ul>


<p>The results of the tests will be used to plan your treatment and adjust it to your specific needs. The tests will help us to identify any changes to your body that occur during or after your treatment.</p>

<p>Your doctor and nurse will explain any other tests that you may need.</p>

<p class="question hidden"><span class="complete">When are these tests done, how are they scheduled? Also, is this list of tests accurate/complete? What about liver function test, biopsies etc.? Also, can we be any more specific about "blood tests" - what sort of blood tests? What is the purpose of the chest x-ray? I'd like to get more detailed, granular with this - this is our one shot to explain their testing.</span> Answer: These tests are part of the pre-transplant evaluation and are scheduled by the BMT Nurse Coordinator. They are done within 30 days prior to the transplant (to get a more complete picture of the patients baseline health and organ function prior to clearing to start high dose chemotherapy). The blood tests are done to evaluate baseline kidney, liver and hematological function (white blood cell, hemoglobin and platelet counts). A baseline chest X-ray is done to ensure the patient has "clear lungs" and no evidence of a pneumonia or other abnormalities.</p>


<h3>Moving into a Nearby Apartment or Hotel</h3>

<p class="question">To be written. How does the patient actually go about getting a space at the Helmsley. Who organizes this?</p>


<h3>Being Fitted with your Central Venous Catheter</h3>

<p>On or before Day −4 you and your caregiver come to MSKCC's Interventional Radiology department at main campus to be fitted with a central venous catheter.</p>

<h4>What is a Central Venous Catheter? Why Do I Need One?</h4>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>A clear diagram of the central venous catheter.</p></div>


<p>A central venous catheter is a tube inserted into a large vein near your collarbone. On the outside of your body the catheter divides into 2 or 3 smaller tubes called "lumens".</p>

<p>A central venous catheter allows your healthcare team to give you medicine, fluids, electrolytes, blood transfusions and chemotherapy without the need to stick you repeatedly with a needle. Having a catheter will make your treatment much more comfortable.</p>

<p>The catheter will stay in your body throughout your treatment and is usually removed around twelve days after you receive your stem cell transplant.</p>

<h4>Before Your Catheter is Fitted</h4>

<p>Before your catheter is fitted you shouldn't take aspirin, any products that contain aspirin, or vitamin E. You should also tell your doctor if you are taking any blood thinners or any medication for diabetes.</p>

<p class="question invisible">Do we need to state this or is the BMT Outpatient Team monitoring/communicating this?</p>


<p></p>

<p>Call your doctor before your procedure if you develop any illness. This includes a fever, cold, flu, or sore throat.</p>

<p>If you have been told to be on a clear liquid diet you shouldn't eat any solid food after midnight the night before your procedure and you should continue to drink clear liquids up to 2 hours before you arrive at the hospital for your procedure.</p>

<h4>The Day of the Catheter Fitting</h4>

<p>Your transplant coordinator will work with you to schedule the fitting of your catheter; it's likely that you'll be asked to report to the Surgical Day Hospital, where the catheter will be fitted, several hours before the procedure takes place. This will allow the medical team to evaluate you and make sure everything is in order before they fit the catheter.</p>

<p>You will probably already be staying in a nearby hotel or apartment. On the morning of the procedure you may shower, but you shouldn't apply any creams or lotions to your body. Take any medications you've been instructed to take.</p>

<p>If you wear contact lenses you should wear glasses on the day you are fitted for your catheter. If you don't own glasses then bring a container for your contact lenses to the hospital with you.</p>

<p>You and your caregiver should leave any valuables or jewelry at home. Bring only your medications and the money you need for the day to the hospital.</p>

<p>Enter the hospital through the main entrance at 1275 York Avenue. Take the M elevators at the top of the escalator to the 2nd floor. As you step off the elevator, enter the double doors to the Surgical Day Hospital. Check in at the desk. Please arrive on time.</p>

<p>In the SDH, you will change into a gown, robe, and slippers. When you are ready, you will be taken to Interventional Radiology.</p>

<h4>The Procedure</h4>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>A diagram or image showing the incision and placement of the catheter. The text is quite intimidating, so it'd be good to show the procedure in reasonable detail to allay fears.</p></div>


<p>An IV line will be started, and you will be given some medication through the IV line to control pain and any anxiety; the medication will relax you. Your blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and oxygen levels will be monitored during your procedure.</p>

<p>Two areas of your body will be numbed with a local anesthetic. A small incision (surgical cut) will be made near your collarbone, usually at the base of your neck. This incision will be used to gain access to the vein where the catheter will be placed.</p>

<p>A second incision will be made on your chest, under your collarbone. The catheter will be inserted through this small incision and tunneled under your skin to the first incision. The catheter will then be threaded into the vein. You may feel a pulling sensation.</p>

<p>A cuff surrounds part of the catheter that lies in the tunnel. This cuff will become anchored in the tunnel about 3 to 4 weeks after your procedure. It prevents bacteria from entering the tunnel and traveling up to your vein. This decreases your risk of infection and prevents your catheter from falling out.</p>

<p>The incision near your collarbone will be stitched closed. The stitches will be absorbed and will not need to be removed. The outside of your incision will be covered with strips of adhesive tape. Your catheter will be stitched to your skin at the point where it exits your body so that it will stay in position. You will be able to see this thread around your catheter.</p>

<p class="question invisible">How long does the procedure take, does the patient need to recuperate at the SDH afterwards or do they go straight home? Useful to put a sense of time around the procedure.</p>


<p>The placement of the catheter should take about 30 minutes.</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Would it be possible to show a photo or diagram of the catheter in place? The "after" picture?</p></div>




<p class="question hidden">Is the person given supplies to take care of their catheter?</p>


<h3>After Your Catheter Has Been Fitted</h3>

<p>After your catheter has been fitted you will be monitored in the Surgical Day Hospital for 2-3 hours before being allowed to return to your hotel or apartment.</p>

<p class="question hidden">I assume that once the catheter has finished the person goes back to their apartment/hotel? Our story needs to travel home with them.</p>


<p>You will need to leave the dressings covering the incision near your collarbone in place and dry for 48 hours. You can remove these dressings after two days and can leave the site of the incision open to the air. The strips of adhesive tape that cover the incision should be left in place until they start to peel off. This should happen about 3 to 5 days after your catheter is fitted.</p>

<p class="question invisible">If the patient gets their catheter on Day-4 and it takes 3-5 days to heal, and weeks to completely anchor in place, doesn't this run into their chemotherapy and transplant (and beyond)? The text in the CVC guide doesn't address this (obviously, as it's a generic guide). Thoughts?</p>


<p>The point where the catheter exits your skin will still need to be covered with a dressing. The stitch at this site keeps your catheter in place until the cuff becomes fully anchored.</p>

<p>If you have discomfort at your incision sites or around the cuff ask your nurse for medication to relieve your pain.</p>

<h4>Taking Care of Your Catheter</h4>

<p>Taking good care of your catheter is important. A nurse will teach you how to care for your catheter. You will learn how to change your dressing while ensuring that it remains free from germs; this is known as "sterile technique". Using sterile technique will minimize your risk for infection. Your caregiver will learn how to change your dressing with you.</p>

<p>To take care of your catheter one of your nurses will give you  supplies including clean dressings, gauze pads, lumen caps, tape, clamps and other essentials.</p>

<p class="question invisible">When will a nurse teach you? Which nurse? Where does this happen?</p>


<p>Your catheter should not interfere with your day to day activities as you get ready for your transplant, but you should avoid strenuous activities and contact sports.</p>

<p>Prepare the following emergency kit and keep it with you at all times:</p>

<p class="question invisible">Where do we introduce the caps, clamps - this is the first time they're mentioned. What do they do in the case of an emergency? (This is covered in the full guide)</p>


<ul>
<li>Two catheter caps</li>
<li>One toothless clamp</li>
<li>Alcohol swabs</li>
<li>One roll of 2-inch tape</li>
<li>Two 2x2 gauze pads</li>
<li>Your doctor's office and emergency telephone numbers.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is a summary of the things you'll do on to take care of your catheter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change the Tegaderm&trade; dressing once a week</li>
<li>Change the caps on the lumens and flush the catheter twice a week</li>
<li>Clamp the catheter when it's not in use</li>
<li>Use a waterproof cover, called an Aquaquard&trade;, over your catheter when showering or bathing</li>
<li>Avoid submerging the catheter in water (e.g. in a swimming pool)</li>
<li>Keep your catheter secure, avoid pulling it or the lumens.</li>
<li>Tape the lumens to your skin, pin them to your clothing, or tape them to your bra if you're a woman.</li>
</ul>


<p class="question">What does this mean: Clamp the catheter when it's not in use</p>


<p>You and your caregiver should be on the look-out for any problems with your catheter. If you notice a discharge from your catheter (a liquid that can vary in color but which is likely to be clear, bloody or yellow/green) or if the exit site around the catheter is red, raw, or swollen, call your doctor. These may be signs of infection.</p>

<p class="question invisible">What does "has drainage" mean?</p>




<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Clamping the catheter above a leak.</p></div>


<p>If your catheter is leaking at any time, clamp it above the leak. Use the white catheter clamp on the catheter, if possible. Wipe the area that is leaking with an alcohol pad and then cover the leak with tape. Follow the instructions in your BMT Emergency Guide; if it is between 8am and 8pm call the BMT Outpatient Clinic. If it is after 8pm call your attending physician or go directly to the urgent care center.</p>

<p class="question invisible">Who specifically do they call? Call the BMT Outpatient clinic?</p>




<p class="question invisible">I edited "Cover the site with tape" rolling it into the sentence "Wipe the area that is leaking with an alcohol pad and then cover the leak with tape". The word "site" felt ambiguous and my assumption is that we're taking about putting tape over the leak.</p>


<p>Full instructions on how to care for your catheter are included in the <em>Caring for Your Central Venous Catheter</em> guide which is included in the appendices. You should read this guide in full and refer to it when you are changing your dressing or caring for your catheter.</p>

<h3>Mobilization and Harvesting</h3>

<p>In an autologous transplant your stem cells are collected ("harvested") from your body before you receive chemotherapy. They are re-introduced into your body after your chemotherapy; this is your stem cell transplant.</p>

<p>On or around Day −4 you will be given an injection of a drug that "mobilizes" your stem cells, then those stem cells will be collected or "harvested" from your bloodstream.</p>

<h4>Mobilization</h4>

<p>Normally your stem cells live in your bone marrow (though a few circulate in your bloodstream) where they are difficult to access and collect for transplantation.</p>

<p>Because of this, you'll be given injections of a drug called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF). GCSF stimulates your body to make more stem cells than usual and encourages them to move into your bloodstream where they can be collected much more easily. This process is called <em>mobilization</em>. GCSF drugs include filgrastim (Neupogen&reg;), pegfilgrastim (Neulasta&reg;) and plerixafor (Mozobil&reg;).</p>

<p>In most cases GCSF injections are self-administered, that is you will inject yourself with the drug while at home. You will be given the GCSF in pre-filled syringes, which you'll keep in your refrigerator. Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will create a personal <em>Mobilization Calendar</em> for you which will tell you when to give yourself the injections. The number of injections needed will depend on a number of factors, including your weight.</p>

<p>A full guide to giving yourself GCSF injections is covered in the document "Directions for Giving an Injection Below the Skin with Neupogen (Filgrastim) or Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) in a Pre-Filled Syringe" which is in the appendices. Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will talk you through this information as well.</p>

<p>Some patients will not give themselves injections of Neupogen or Neulasta (both types of GCSF), and will instead be given a different type of GCSF called Mozobil. If Mozobil is recommended for you then the injections will be given by a nurse in the BMT clinic.</p>

<p class="question invisible">How many injections, when are the GCSF injections given, by whom, where etc.</p>


<h4>Harvesting of your Stem Cells</h4>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>The harvesting/collection process.</p></div>




<p class="question">Where does mobilization/harvesting happen, when etc? I want to put this in the context of the Outpatient BMT process and give clear instructions.</p>


<p>The injections of GCSF into your body will stimulate the growth and mobilization of your stem cells. Now, they'll be harvested (also called "collected") from your body through a procedure called <em>apheresis</em>.</p>

<p>Apheresis is very similar to giving blood. You will lie in a chair or bed in the Blood Donor Room. An IV line will be put into a vein in your arm and a machine will separate the stem cells from your blood.</p>

<p>If your catheter has already been fitted then it might be used for harvesting instead of an IV line. In this case one of the lumens of your catheter will be connected to the machine that separates the stem cells from your blood.</p>

<p>Between 1 and 5 sessions will be needed to harvest enough stem cells, and each session will last 3 to 4 hours. Most patients experience no side effects from the harvesting process.</p>

<p>After your stem cells are harvested, they are frozen and stored until your transplant day.</p>

<h3>Receiving Your Chemotherapy</h3>

<ul>
<li>When does it happen: Day −2.</li>
</ul>


<p>Two days before your transplant you'll receive your chemotherapy. (This process is also called "conditioning" because it conditions, or prepares, your body for transplant). Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will work with you to schedule and explain your day of chemotherapy.</p>

<p>You'll be treated with a chemotherapy drug called Melphalan. Information about Melphalan, including its side effects, is included in the appendices.</p>

<p>This will be a busy day. Not only will you receive your chemotherapy, but you'll also meet your Clinical Pharmacist who will review your medications with you and show you how to use your pill box. You and your caregiver will also be given a lot of information about the rest of your treatment and what to expect - some of this information will be on paper and some of it will be verbal. Your caregiver might like to bring a notebook and pen to the clinic to note down key points and any questions.</p>

<h4>The Morning before Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>On the morning of Day −2 you and your caregiver should come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic at MSKCC's main campus at 8am. You should wear comfortable, loose everyday clothes - loose fitting tops or shirts that open to the front (so that we can access your catheter), comfortable pants (sweat pants or track suit). You can expect to be in the BMT Clinic for 6 to 10 hours, so you might want to bring newspapers, books, a laptop or tablet computer - things to pass the time.</p>

<p>Once you arrive at the BMT Outpatient Clinic You will be brought to your own private room. A nurse practitioner will review your medical history and ask you a set of questions about how you're feeling. Your vital signs will be checked and you will be weighed.</p>

<p>Once you have been fully evaluated you will meet with the Clinical Pharmacist. The Pharmacist will talk through the medications you will take throughout your treatment and will give you a full list of these medications.</p>

<p>Some of your medications will be "self-administered" in that you and your caregiver will manage them. You'll take your self-administered medications on a regular schedule or as needed. The Pharmacist will give you a a medication box (also called a pill box) that you'll use to store and manage your self-administered medications. The pharmacist will explain how to use and refill the pill box.</p>

<p class="question hidden">Could you walk me through what happens here in detail? They arrive, who do they meet, where do they go etc.</p>


<h4>Receiving Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>Once you have been evaluated and the Pharmacist has talked through your medications, you'll be brought to a nearby chemotherapy suite where you'll receive your chemotherapy. You are free to bring newspapers, books, your tablet or computer with you.</p>

<p>Before you receive your chemotherapy it goes through a number of safety checks to make sure everything is correct.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your chemotherapy is ordered by your doctor</li>
<li>A nurse checks your chemotherapy order</li>
<li>A pharmacist checks your chemotherapy order</li>
<li>A pharmacist checks your blood test results</li>
<li>Your chemotherapy is prepared in the Pharmacy</li>
<li>A pharmacist performs a comprehensive final check of your chemotherapy</li>
<li>Your chemotherapy is picked up by your chemotherapy nurse</li>
<li>2 chemotherapy nurses check to make sure your chemotherapy order, blood test results, and chemotherapy are correct</li>
</ul>


<p>Once all the safety checks have been complete the nurse will administer fluids (to keep you hydrated), anti-nausea medication and the chemotherapy drug through your catheter.</p>

<p class="question invisible">How long does this take? Can the caregiver remain with the patient?</p>


<h4>During your Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>Your chemotherapy will take several hours to administer, so you will be provided with meals.</p>

<p>During your chemotherapy your healthcare team will use this time to talk to you about the rest of your transplant journey.</p>

<p>The healthcare team will make sure that the logistics of the next few days are clear - what happens on transplant day and what happens after your transplant.</p>

<p>They'll talk to you about the side effects you'll start to experience after your chemotherapy. You'll be given printed materials that explain these side effects in detail and you'll be shown what to do if you need to get help while you are in your apartment/hotel.</p>

<p>You'll be introduced to the "Patient Temperature and Oral Intake Diary" that you and your caregiver will use to record your temperature and hydration every four hours while you are awake.</p>

<p>You and your caregiver should use the day of chemotherapy to ask as many questions as possible; make sure you are absolutely satisfied that you have all the information you need. Your healthcare team will do everything they can to answer your questions.</p>

<h4>After Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>When you finish chemotherapy you will return home to your apartment or hotel. You will rest for one day before your transplant.</p>

<p class="move invisible">Move this or rewrite: During this period your blood cell counts will be very low. You will be at high risk for infection until your bone marrow begins to make new blood cells. To reduce the risk, everyone who enters your room will follow special rules. Your doctor and nurse will explain these in detail.</p>


<h4>Side Effects of Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>Your chemotherapy will kill the cancerous cells in your body and will prepare your bone marrow to receive your transplant. However, the side effects associated with chemotherapy are not to be taken lightly. These side effects will include the loss of your ability to heal and fight infections, infertility, hair loss, fatigue, nausea, mouth sores and mouth tenderness.</p>

<p>Your healthcare team will help you understand and prepare for these side effects. Before you receive your chemotherapy make a list of questions that you would like to ask about these side effects. Talk through these questions with your caregiver and your healthcare team.</p>

<p class="question">What about peripheral neuropathy?</p>


<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Neutropenia and Low Platelet Level</h4>

<p>Your chemotherapy will severely damage your ability to fight infections and heal - it's important that you understand why this happens, how to watch for danger signs, and how to avoid infections and injuries.</p>

<p>One debilitating side effect of chemotherapy is called "<strong>neutropenia</strong>". Neutropenia is a condition where you have a a lower than normal number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in your bloodstream. Neutrophils play a crucial role in your immune system - they are one of the first types of cells that travel to the site of an infection. Once they reach the site of an infection they ingest and fight potentially harmful microorganisms.</p>

<p>Because your chemotherapy will kill your stem cells, you lose the ability to make new neutrophils. Because your neutrophils are not being replaced in your body, in the days after your chemotherapy the number of neutrophils in your bloodstream will drop to a very low level, leaving you vulnerable to infections. You and your caregiver will work together to watch for any sign of infection. You'll keep a regular record of your temperature and other vital signs, even when you are in your hotel or apartment and you will have to take very careful precautions to avoid infections.</p>

<p>As well as losing your ability to make neutrophils and other types of white blood cells, you'll also lose your ability to make <strong>platelets</strong>. Platelets are little fragments of larger cells made in your bone marrow; they break off from these larger cells and flow through your bloodstream - living for just a few days before being replaced. They clump together to help stop bleeding. Because you will have a very low platelet count after your chemotherapy you will take special care to avoid cuts and strenuous activities that might cause bleeding. You'll take special care of your gums and mouth, because it's quite common for bleeding to start here.</p>

<p>After your transplant your healthcare team will regularly take samples of your blood to count the number of neutrophils and platelets in your bloodstream.</p>

<p>As your stem cells take hold and start to make new blood cells the number of neutrophils in your bloodstream (sometimes referred to as your Absolute Neutrophil Count or ANC) will increase, as will your number of platelets (called your platelet count) - these are collectively known as "your counts" and they are key signs that your transplant has worked. You'll hear the term "counts" used frequently by your healthcare team.</p>

<p>More in-depth guides to living with neutropenia and low platelet levels are included later in this guide under Phase 3: After Your Transplant.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Infertility</h4>

<p>Chemotherapy drugs that kill rapidly-dividing cancer cells will also affect you fertility. It's highly likely that your chemotherapy will mean that you will not be able to conceive a child naturally - if you would like to have children in the future you can make arrangements to have your sperm or eggs frozen before your chemotherapy. Collecting and freezing sperm before your chemotherapy will enable you and your partner to attempt pregnancy when you are ready.</p>

<p>The first step is to schedule an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist. Reproductive endocrinologists are doctors with special training in fertility and reproductive health. The reproductive endocrinologist will evaluate your fertility and will give you advice on how best to proceed.</p>

<p>It's also very important that you speak to your insurance company. They will tell you if the costs associated with infertility treatment are covered under your policy. Even if your insurance does not cover infertility there may be other  programs or grants that can help you pay for your infertility treatment. These are described in the Fertility and Cancer Treatment guides which are included in the appendices.</p>

<p>Typically <strong>men</strong> who want to have children after their chemotherapy opt to have their sperm collected and frozen, this is called sperm banking.</p>

<p>If you are a man and wish to donate sperm you will travel to a sperm bank facility between one and three times. At the sperm bank you will ejaculate into a cup. The sperm bank will analyze the semen, counting the number of sperm. They will also study the shape of your sperm and their motility (ability to swim). If the sperm look healthy, the sperm bank will divide the specimen into small vials and freeze and store them.</p>

<p>Sperm can be stored for as long as is necessary and a yearly storage fee will apply.</p>

<p><strong>Women</strong> who want to have children after their chemotherapy can have eggs or fertilized embryos collected and stored beforehand.</p>

<p>If you are a woman and wish to store your eggs or embryos for future fertilization, first the reproductive endocrinologist will examine you and review your medical history before discussing your options.</p>

<p>If banking your eggs or embryos is an option and you decide to proceed on or around the first day of your period you will start giving yourself daily hormone injections. This medicine will stimulate your ovaries to make more eggs than usual. You will continue this for one to two weeks.</p>

<p>While you are taking the daily injections, you will see your reproductive endocrinologist every day or every other day for blood tests and transvaginal ultrasounds.</p>

<p>Once you have enough mature eggs, you will give yourself a different injection to stimulate ovulation. Within 36 hours you will have an egg retrieval. The egg retrieval is an outpatient procedure done using anesthesia - you will be asleep and no surgical incision is needed. The eggs are collected using a very thin needle that is passed through your vagina.</p>

<p>From this point it's possible to fertilize your eggs with sperm and freeze the resulting embryos. This is called embryo cryopreservation.</p>

<p>An alternative to embryo cryopreservation is egg (oocyte) cryopreservation. This involves freezing eggs that have not been fertilized. When you are ready to use them, the eggs are thawed and fertilized with sperm. This is a newer technology and is still considered experimental but may be preferred by women who do not have a male partner during this time.</p>

<p>Whether you decide to freeze embryos or eggs, they will be stored at an egg bank until you are ready and you have been medically cleared to start a family. A yearly storage fee will apply.</p>

<p>For more detailed information about infertility associated with cancer treatment and your options you should consult the Fertility and Cancer Treatment guides included in the appendices. These guides also list reproductive endocrinologists in the area. You should also talk with your bone marrow transplant doctor about options to preserve your fertility.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Hair Loss</h4>

<p class="outstanding">To be written</p>


<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Nausea, Fatigue</h4>

<p>Other side effects from you chemotherapy could include fatigue, nausea, diarrhea and mouth sores or mouth tenderness.</p>

<p class="outstanding">To be written</p>


<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - The Importance of Communication</h4>

<p>Throughout your treatment it's very important that you communicate clearly with your healthcare team and your caregiver about your side effects.</p>

<p>Tell your healthcare team how you're feeling. Describe how your body feels. Describe how you're doing emotionally. Tell them if anything is worrying you. If you notice changes in how you feel describe what has changed. If anything bothers you, even if it seems minor, tell your healthcare team. The more information you can communicate to your healthcare team the more they'll be able to help you. There is usually something that they can do to make you feel more comfortable.</p>

<h3>Rest Day</h3>

<p>The day after you receive your chemotherapy is a rest day. This rest day allows the chemotherapy drug to work and then leave your body. When you receive your stem cells there will be no trace of the chemotherapy drug in your body, so the transplanted stem cells will not be harmed.</p>

<h4>Monitoring Temperature and Fluid Intake</h4>

<p>From now on your caregiver must take your temperature every four hours and write it in the "Temperature and Oral Intake Diary".</p>

<p class="question">Where does the caregiver get the thermometer from?</p>


<p>If your temperature is 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher your caregiver needs follow the instructions on your BMT Emergency Guide; if it is between 8am and 8pm call the BMT Outpatient Clinic at (212) 639-2399. If it is after 8pm call (212) 639-2000 and ask for the doctor covering bone marrow transplant.</p>

<p>It's really important that you drink a lot of fluids from now on. As well as taking your temperature your caregiver will also monitor all of the fluids you drink and record the volume you drink in the Intake Diary. You should drink 2 liters or 64 fluid ounces of fluids each day. Try to drink steadily throughout the day; little and often.</p>

<p>Your caregiver should bring the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary to the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day. A nurse practitioner will review the diary with you.</p>

<p class="question invisible">Do we need to describe what should happen on the rest day? Has the caregiver already been monitoring the patient's vitals and fluid intake, or is this the first day?</p>


<h3>Other Things to Consider in Phase 1</h3>

<p class="outstanding">Need to bring the childcare, pets, exercise, emotional support in here. Need input from the Social Work team; this is pending. They are aware that I need content.</p>


<h3>Checklist</h3>

<p>Before your outpatient treatment starts, there are a number of arrangements to make and options to consider. Use this checklist to keep track of things you need to do before your transplant.</p>

<ul>

<h2>Phase 2 - Your Transplant</h2>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Diagram of the transplant process/timeline with a "you are here" marker on Phase Two, or highlighting of some kind.</p></div>


<h3>One Page Summary of This Phase</h3>

<p>Phase 2 of your treatment last just one day. On Day 0, your transplant day, your stem cells will be taken from storage and infused into your body through your catheter.</p>

<p>These are the key things that will happen during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stem Cells Retrieved - Your stem cells will be taken from storage and thawed.</li>
<li>Transplantation - Your stem cells will be infused into your body through your catheter.</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these activities in detail later in this section.</p>

<h4>Topics</h4>

<p>It's also important that you know about these topics during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Topic 1</li>
<li>Topic 2</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these topics in detail later in this section.</p>

<p class="question">It probably makes more sense to speak about living with neutropenia, monitoring symptoms, infection control in phase three. This is such a short phase that there may be no other topics worth adding into this section. TBD. </p>


<h4>Actions - Things You Need to Do</h4>

<p>At the end of this chapter you'll find a list of things we need you to do during this phase of your treatment. Read this section in full then start to work your way through this list of actions.</p>

<h3>Transplant Day</h3>

<p>Now that you've received chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells in your body, it's time for your transplant. The stem cells that were separated from your blood and frozen earlier will be re-infused into your body. These stem cells will give you back your ability to make new blood and fight infections.</p>

<h4>The Morning Before Transplant</h4>

<p>On the morning of your transplant you should arrive at the Outpatient BMT Clinic at MSKCC's main campus. Give yourself extra time to get to the clinic, as you may feel tired after your chemotherapy.</p>

<p>Once you arrive at the clinic…</p>

<p class="question">I'd like to get a clear picture of what exactly happens when the patient gets to the clinic. </p>


<h4>The Transplant</h4>

<p>Before your transplant, your frozen stem cells will be removed from storage at our blood bank and brought to your room. The stem cells are stored in clear plastic bags that look like a bag of blood. The bags will be placed in a warm water bath to thaw.</p>

<p>Once the stem cells are thawed, the nurse practitioner or doctor will infuse the stem cells into your body through your catheter.</p>

<p class="question">How long does the transplant (the infusion of the stem cells) take from start to finish?</p>


<p>You may have experience some side effects as the stem cells are given to you through your catheter. The common ones are nausea, vomiting, a tickle in your throat, or a cough. You will be given some medicine about 30 minutes before your transplant to help reduce these side effects. It's important that you communicate with the healthcare team and with your caregiver during your transplant; let them know how you're feeling especially if something doesn't feel right.</p>

<p>During and after your transplant you may notice a strong, garlic-like taste in your mouth. Your urine, sweat, and skin may also have a garlic-like smell. This is caused by the preservative used to store your stem cells. The small will gradually go away over 1 to 2 days.</p>

<p class="question">I just want to validate that the small could be present during *and* after the transplant. Also, when it's mentioned that "The Nutrition Department will provide lemons" - how is it envisaged that the lemons are used. Cut them, leave them around? Why lemons, because they're natural, non-chemical, non-toxic?</p>


<h4>After Your Transplant</h4>

<p class="question">What happens directly after the transplant? I'd like to travel with the patient from the room where they receive their transplant to their hotel/apartment.</p>


<p>Almost immediately after your stem cells are infused into your body they will travel through your bloodstream into your bone marrow.</p>

<p>Once the stem cells arrive in your bone marrow they begin to "engraft", forming bonds with surrounding tissues and becoming fixed in place. They'll begin to divide and differentiate, creating more stem cells and making the different components of your blood including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.</p>

<h3>Other Things to Consider in Phase 2</h3>

<p class="question">I don't believe there are any in-depth topics to add in here. </p>

* Infection Control - How to avoid getting sick


## Preparing For Your Transplant



### Managing your Emotions
Learning that you may have a stem cell transplant can be a very emotional time for you and your loved ones, but there are things you can do and ways we can help.
Talk with your transplant team.
Fear of the disease, treatment, and even the unknown are common and normal. You may want to talk with your social worker, doctor, or nurse about your feelings. If you're feeling anxious or depressed, your doctor may prescribe a medication to help you deal with the stress. There are many resources available to you as a patient at MSKCC; you can find information about them in the Resources section of this guide.
Ask Questions.
Learning about your illness and transplant helps some people decrease fear of the unknown. The transplant process can be overwhelming because many things are happening. By making a list of your worries or questions, you can focus on just a couple of your concerns at a time. Your transplant team expects you to have questions and will answer them.
Share your feelings and thoughts.
Sharing how you feel with others and what you think about your transplant is another way that may decrease the burden. Some patients find this difficult because they don't want to worry their family and friends. However, not knowing how you feel or how to help may worry them even more. Sharing feelings and thoughts can bring people together at a time of stress. You may also ask your social worker about a support group that may be helpful.

### Fertility


### Exercise
Being in the best physical health you can before your transplant will help you recover. Before your transplant, work with your doctor and/or physical therapist to develop an exercise plan that's right for you. Walking or doing some form of exercise every day will help prepare your body for transplant.

### Eating Well
When preparing for your transplant, eat a well- balanced diet high in protein, vitamins, and minerals. It's important to be in the best physical health you can be before your transplant because you will have difficulty eating during some periods of time during your transplant.



### Hair Care
Most patients will lose their hair during transplant, which can be a traumatic experience. Some patients choose to cut their hair short before transplant to lessen the shock of losing their hair. Whether or not you choose to cut your hair, before your transplant is a good time to think about whether you might want a wig. If a wig is something your considering, you may wish to visit a wig store while you still have your hair, or with
a clipping of your hair if you would like the wig
to match your natural hair. There are wig stores in the New York area listed in the Resource section of this guide. Scarves and hats are other accessories that you might consider. Some patients choose not to wear anything at all, or to decide when the time comes.

### Financial and Insurance
Unwritten.

### Getting More Information
Different people look for different amounts of information about their cancer treatment. If you would like to know more than what is in this binder, there are a number of ways to get reliable information. Talking to your healthcare team
is the best way to get information about your treatment options. Many people also go to the internet. While the internet is a great resource for information, it is important to go to reliable sources. You can find websites suggested by the MSKCC staff on the LIBGUIDES section on MSKCC's website at www.mskcc.org. If you prefer, you can call the library reference staff at (212) 639-7439 for assistance finding reliable information.
Many patients find they collect a lot of information as they prepare for their transplant. Use this binder to organize the information in one place and write down any questions for your healthcare team. Remember to bring this binder with you to all your MSKCC appointments.





## During Your Transplant
Your transplant process begins with **unwritten**



#### Caring for your Skin
Keeping yourself clean is very important. You
will have a routine to clean your skin each day with antibacterial soap. Begin with your upper body, then the middle section, and wash the lower area including your feet last. Pay extra attention to washing your underarms, groin, and the area between your genitals and rectum. Germs tend to live in these moist areas. You may shampoo your scalp with ordinary soap once a day.
After you urinate or move your bowels, wash your buttocks and genital area with antibacterial soap. You can also use moist wipes. Pat the area dry. Wash your hands well afterward.
Keep the skin around your IV catheter very clean. The dressing that covers and protects it will be changed weekly, as long as it is dry and covered. To reduce the chance of infection, do not allow the IV tubing to touch the floor.

### Eating Well
During your transplant, your appetite may decrease. This is expected. You eat and drink
as much as you can without forcing yourself. Nutritional shakes or supplements can be helpful as you go through this period.
Your dietitian and nurse are here to help you when you are not able to eat as you usually do. By the time your treatment is complete, you will be able to drink enough liquids and eat small amounts
of food.

### Caring for your Teeth and Mouth
It is very important to take good care of your teeth and mouth during your transplant. This will help prevent infections and sores in your mouth. Follow these guidelines:
* You will be given a mouthwash to rinse your mouth before and after meals and at bedtime. The number of rinses may be increased to every 2 hours, depending on how your mouth feels.
* Use only the mouthwash that your nurse gives you. Do not use mouthwash or toothpaste from any store. These products irritate and dry the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat.
* Use an ultra soft toothbrush. You may also use Toothettes&reg; disposable foam sticks.
* Do not use dental floss.
* Avoid licking your lips. It increases drying and chapping.
* Apply a lubricant after mouth care and every 2 to 4 hours as needed. This will help keep your lips moist.
* To avoid an infection in your mouth, the doctor will prescribe an oral antifungal antibiotic.
* If your mouth becomes sensitive, avoid hot, spicy, acidic, or coarse foods. You may prefer soft or liquid food served chilled or at room temperature.
* If your mouth feels very painful, your doctor will prescribe medicine for the pain.

### Low Microbial Diet
**Refer to full Low Micro Diet guide**
This information will help you follow a low microbial diet. Eating a low microbial diet will reduce your risk of getting ill while you have a weakened immune system, such as after chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a bone marrow transplant.
The first section of this booklet has information on how to keep your food safe. The second section explains what foods and beverages are safe to eat while on a low microbial diet. Don't make any changes to this
diet until you have talked to someone on your healthcare team. This includes your doctor, nurse, nurse practitioner, or dietitian.

Food Safety Guidelines

#### What are microbes?
Microbes are tiny living organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, yeast, and molds. They can get into food by infecting the animal the food comes from. Microbes can also get into food when it is being processed or prepared. When microbes get into foods, they can cause infections, especially if you have a low white blood cell count (neutropenia).
Microbes can attach to foods and grow, but you can't always see, smell, or taste them. They are more likely to grow on
* Milk and other dairy food items that are not refrigerated
* Undercooked and raw eggs and foods that have raw eggs (e.g., cookie dough and Caesar salad dressing)
* Undercooked or raw meat, poultry (chicken and turkey), and seafood
* Certain fruits and vegetables (see the Fruits and Vegetable list in the “What to Eat on a Low Microbial Diet” section)
* Unpasteurized or untreated juices (e.g., fresh-squeezed juices)
* Vegetable sprouts (e.g., raw alfalfa, soy bean, and radish sprouts)

#### Buying foods that are safe to eat
* Don't buy canned foods if the can has dents or is swollen.
* Don't buy food in jars if the jar is cracked or the lid is not tightly closed.
* Only buy eggs that are refrigerated in the store. Check the eggs by opening the carton to see if any are broken or cracked.
* Separate ready-to-eat and raw foods. Put
raw meat, poultry, seafood, and other raw foods in plastic bags before they go into your shopping cart.
* Pick up your milk and other cold foods at the end of your shopping trip. This decreases the time these items will spend outside of the refrigerator.
* Check containers for the expiration date. Buy and use food before that date.

### Storing food safely
* Store food immediately after shopping.
* Put eggs and milk inside the refrigerator; don't store them in the door. The temperature inside the refrigerator will stay cooler than in the door area.

#### Keeping your kitchen clean
* Keep an area of your kitchen clean for preparing and eating food. This will help prevent the spread of microbes.
* Use paper towels or clean cloths instead of sponges to clean kitchen surfaces.
* Use an antibacterial cleansing spray to clean surfaces. Look for products that have bleach or ammonia. Examples are Lysol® Food Surface Sanitizer and Clorox® Clean-Up® Cleaner.

Using cutting boards and equipment
* Use cutting boards that are made out of
thick plastic, marble, glass, or ceramic. These materials are nonporous, meaning that food or liquid substances can't absorb into them. Avoid using wood or other porous surfaces.
* Wash cutting boards and knives with hot soapy water before using them to cut the next food. As an extra precaution, wash your cutting boards with a kitchen sanitizer. Throw out worn or hard-to-clean cutting boards.

Handling food safely
* Wash your hands thoroughly
– Before preparing or eating food
– After preparing raw poultry, meat, fish, or seafood
– After handling garbage
* Thoroughly rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under running tap water. Rinse skins and rinds before cutting or peeling. Never use bleach or detergent to wash fresh fruits and vegetables.

* Rub firm-skinned fruits and vegetables under running warm tap water or scrub them with a clean vegetable brush while rinsing with running tap water.
* Remove and throw away any damaged or bruised areas on fruits or vegetables.
* Cook all foods thoroughly.
* Separate raw meats from ready-to-eat foods.
* Thaw foods by using only 1 of the following methods:
– Put the food item in the refrigerator 1 day before cooking.
– Use the defrost setting on a microwave. Cook right away.
* Keep your refrigerator at a temperature of 33° F to 40° F.
* Keep your freezer at a temperature of 0° F or below.
* Use a food thermometer to check the temperatures of cooked and reheated foods.
* Don't eat hamburgers and other meat products if the meat looks undercooked. Cook the meat until it is grey and the juices run clear.
* Cook fish until it flakes.
* Cook egg whites and yolks until they are firm.
* Cook all meats to the minimum internal temperatures listed in the chart below.

## Transplant Day

## After your Autologous stem Cell Transplant
Now that you've had your transplant, you enter a period of watching and waiting for engraftment to occur. Engraftment occurs when the bone marrow begins to form the cells that give rise to mature blood cells. It will first be seen as your white cell count starts to rise. Recovery of the red blood cells occurs more slowly. Platelets tend to recover last.
During this time you will come into the clinic everyday. Your blood will

be taken daily to assess and track your blood cell levels, and your vital signs will continue to be checked frequently. You and/or your caregiver will keep track of how much fluid you drink and your temperature while you are not in the clinic.
After your transplant you'll need to continue to follow the low microbial diet explained in the During your Stem Cell Transplant section of this guide.

### Checklist
You must bring the following items to your clinic appointment everyday:
All prescription medications you were instructed to take during the bone marrow transplant period.
Comfortable day clothes – sweat pants, large t-shirts, shirts that open in the front, and shoes with traction like sneakers
Notebook – keep a list of questions for your health care team
Your temperature and oral intake record You may also find it helpful to have the
following items with you in clinic:
A list of all prescription and non- prescription medications you are taking with dosages and frequency. Include vitamins, nutritional supplements, herbal products and over-the-counter drugs.
Lip moisturizer, such as ChapStick® Distractions – books, magazines, music, or
puzzles to help pass the time
Cell phone
Laptop, iPad®, iPod® or other electronic device

### Emotional Support
Being away from home for a long time, the slow recovery after transplant, and low energy may be frustrating. Dealing with your feelings can help you cope with treatment and feel better. You may want to talk with your social worker, doctor, or nurse about your feelings.

### Connecting with Children
Children under 12 are not able to visit you during your transplant period because of the risk of infection. This separation may be difficult for you, your child, and the rest of your family. We know from past experience that patients with children experience a range of feelings and reactions related to this separation. To help you, we have created the following tips for helping you and your child stay connected. In addition, your social worker is available to talk with you about your concerns.

 Record a song to send home. Ask your nurse for a referral for Music Therapy to help
• Use a webcam to Skype using your computer
• Paint or create other crafts to send home. Supplies are provided by the Patient Recreation Center.
• Write letters, notes, or cards and mail them every few days.
• Give your child a special coloring book or journal for times when they miss you are feelings are difficult. Pictures can be mailed or taken to you by your next visitor.
• Record a video or story read by you that can be played for your child
• Ask your child to help decorate your room by providing drawings every few days.

### Rest and Relaxation

## Neutropenia (low White Blood Cell Count)
This information will help you avoid infection while your white blood cell count is low. This is called neutropenia.
Neutrophils are white blood cells (WBC). They help your body fight infections. You must follow the instructions described on this card to prevent infection until your neutrophil count returns to normal. You should also be aware of signs of infection and report them to your doctor or nurse. Be sure to take your temperature orally (by mouth), as directed by your doctor or nurse.

### General Hygiene

• Shower or bathe daily. Wash carefully under your arms, in the anal and genital areas, and in skin folds.
• Use soap that can kill germs. Look for the words “antibacterial” or “antimicrobial.” Dial® is one example, but there are many others.

• Perform mouth care after each meal. Use an ultra-soft toothbrush and brush and rinse as directed by your doctor or nurse.
• Use antibacterial hand gels (such as Purell®) after shaking hands and after contact with young children.

Steps to Prevent Infection

• Avoid having visitors to your home who have colds or recent infections.
• Hold off on having any dental work or procedure that is not urgent. Speak with your doctor or nurse first.

• Ask your doctor or nurse if you can – Use tampons
– Use suppositories
– Have enemas

• Do not eat raw meats, raw fish, or raw eggs. Please ask your nurse or dietitian for the resource The Low Bacterial Diet if you have not already received that information.

• Do not share eating or drinking utensils.
• Do not get a manicure, pedicure, waxing, or tattoo without the approval of your doctor or nurse.
• Do not shave your scalp or any other part of the body. Use caution when shaving your face. If possible, use an electric razor.
• Do not touch any animal waste products (i.e., litter boxes, fish tanks, pet cages).
• Do not garden or handle soil.

When to Contact Your Doctor or Nurse
Call your doctor or nurse if you have any of the following signs of infection:
• A temperature of 100.4° F (38° C) or higher
• Shaking chills
• Nausea and vomiting that is not getting any better
• Flushed face
• Sweats
• Cough
• Diarrhea
• Mouth sores
• Headache
• New onset of pain
• Irritability
• Pain or burning during urination
• Feeling tired, especially if you also have flu-like symptoms
You may have to come to the hospital.
If you have any problems or questions, speak with your
Doctor ______________________ (212) _____________________
Nurse _______________________ (212) _____________________
After 5 pm and on weekends, call (212) 639-2000 and ask to speak to the doctor covering your service.

## Guidelines for Patients with a low Platelet Count
Platelets are colorless cells that are a part of blood. They are produced in bone marrow, the soft, spongy center in most of our large bones. The main function of platelets is to control bleeding. A normal plate- let count is 150,000-400,000 platelets per microliter (mcl) of blood.

If your doctor has told you that you have a low platelet count, it is very important that you take pre- cautions to prevent bleeding. You must also recognize any signs of bleeding so you can report them to your doctor or nurse. Precautions and signs of bleeding are listed below. Your platelet count may be low because of the cancer or its treatment.
Protective measures to avoid bleeding:
• Self-Care
– Avoid sharp objects such as a straightedge razor, scissors, and nail clippers.
– Use a soft toothbrush.
– Blow your nose gently, if at all.
• Perineal care
– Do not use rectal suppositories, enemas, or tampons.
– Do not take your temperature rectally.
– Consider using stool softeners or laxatives if you are straining to have bowel movements.
• Dressing
– Avoid tight clothing such as a girdle and tight undergarments or pants.
• Activities
– Wear gloves when gardening, cooking, and doing home repairs.
– Avoid any activity that may result in injury. This includes any
• Contact sports.
• Climbing ladders.
• Strenuous exercise. • Bicycling.
• Weight lifting.
• Sexual activity
– Use lubrication if needed.
– Avoid anal or oral intercourse. – Avoid strong thrusting.
• Medicines
– Do not take
• Aspirin.
• Products that have aspirin.
• Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), such as Advil®. • Vitamin E.
Ask for the card that lists common products with these medicines.
• Dental care
– Speak with your doctor before you have any routine or elective dental work.
• Do not have – Manicures. – Pedicures. – Waxing.
– Electrolysis. – Tattoos.

Call your doctor if you develop any symptoms of bleeding:
• Excessive bruising.
• Afaintredrashonyourtrunk,arms,andlegs.
• Vaginalspottingorheavymenstrualbleeding.
• The appearance of broken blood vessels in the “white of the eye” (sclera).

Steps to be taken if bleeding occurs at home:
1. Apply direct pressure on the bleeding site.
2. After applying pressure, call your MSKCC doctor. If you are unable to reach your doctor, and bleeding does not stop, go to a local emergency room.
3. Apply ice over the bridge of your nose for nosebleeds.

Call your doctor immediately if you have:
• Black bowel movements, blood in the stool, or rectal bleeding.
• Blood in your urine.
• Headaches that do not get better, blurred vision, dizziness.
• Any bleeding that does not get better (coughing up blood, vomiting blood, nose bleeds).

### Donating Blood and Platelets
Patients often need red blood cells and platelets when their counts are too low. We ask family members and friends to donate blood and are grateful when they can do it. Any blood donation helps our patients. When you start treatment, ask a family member to call the Blood Donor program to find out about giving blood. The number is (212) 639-8177. It takes about two hours to donate platelets and about 45 minutes for red blood cells. Donors can call (212) 639-7648 to make an appointment.

Blood donors must:
• Be 17 to 75 years of age.
• Weigh over 110 pounds (50 kg).
• Not have signs of a cold or active allergy at the time of donation.
• Not have or have had an illness such as hepatitis, jaundice, cancer, etc.
• Call the donor room if they are taking any medicine.

Not take aspirin, or any compound that has aspirin or aspirin-like drugs
(ibuprofen, Motrin®, Naprosyn®, Anaprox®, Advil®, Aleve®) within three days before giving blood. It is okay to take Tylenol® or Anacin 3®.
• Not drink alcohol 8 hours before donating.
• Eat a light meal, but avoid fatty foods before donating.

Platelets are a type of blood cell that helps the blood clot and stop bleeding
Irradiated blood products have been exposed to radiation to prevent white blood cells from dividing.
Neutropenia is a low white blood cell count, making a person at high risk for an infection

### Fatigue and Weakness
When your red blood cell count (RBC) is low, you may feel tired. You may need extra help with your daily activities. Try to walk every day to maintain your muscle tone and strength. You may also receive red blood cell transfusions as needed. These and all other blood products will be irradiated to prevent adverse side effects.

Emotional Recovery
Recovery takes time. Sometimes people feel isolated and alone. You might wonder if what you are feeling is normal, and your caregivers might wonder how to reassure you. Here are some things you can do:
• Discuss your experiences with your doctor or nurse. They can provide you with guidance about what to expect during recovery from transplant as well as what you can do to help.
• Talk with your social worker for support and counseling.
• Consider joining a support group. These
are available in person or on the Internet. Cancer Care (www.cancercare.org) and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (www.lls. org) are great resources. MSKCC's Resources for Life After Cancer program also has support groups, and they can be reached at (212) 888-4740.

Consider talking with someone else who
has been through transplant. The volunteer department here at MSKCC has patient volunteers. You can reach them at (212) 639- 5007. Cancer Care (www.cancercare.org) and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (www.lls.org) also offer these services.

Explore educational materials. The National Marrow Donor Program (www.marrow. org), The Bone Marrow Foundation (www. bonemarrow.org), Cancer Care (www. cancercare.org) and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (www.lls.org) also offer educational materials.
• The Counseling Center at MSKCC has psychologists and psychiatrists available for consultations, therapy, and treatment of
the depression and anxiety that you may experience after your transplant. They also offer family and couples counseling. You can reach them at (646) 888-0100.
Remember, you are not alone. Your transplant team has worked with many other patients and caregivers who have experienced similar feelings. It is normal to need guidance after transplant and communication is an important part of your recovery.
