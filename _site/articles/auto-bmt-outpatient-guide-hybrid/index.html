<p class="question hidden"><span class="complete">Some of the topics align neatly to phases, some don't. Should we summarize the most important information about topic, then refer to a more complete version in the appendix? That would be my recommendation. Say for example we are in Phase 2, could we summarize issues related to fertility, then refer the person to a longer guide at the back of our guide?)</span> Decision: Yes, summarize and refer to complete guides.</p>


<h2>Welcome, Overview</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Outpatient Autologous Stem Cell Transplant program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.</p>

<h3>What's in This Guide?</h3>

<p>This guide will help you learn about autologous transplantation; what it is and why it's been recommended for you. The guide will become an important part of your transplant journey and will add to the verbal information you receive from doctors, nurses, social workers and other members of your healthcare team.</p>

<p>We hope that the general information in this guide will help you prepare for your transplant; you'll learn about the key phases of your treatment and the team who will care for you. We'll help you prepare for each phase, recommend things you should do and things you should avoid.</p>

<p>We'll also recommend further reading on useful topics like sexual activity, diet and exercise.</p>

<h3>How To Use This Booklet?</h3>

<p>You should read this booklet completely at least once, then use refer to it as your treatment progresses.</p>

<p>As you read through the booklet make a note of any questions that come to mind. Your doctor, or a member of your healthcare team, can answer your questions when you see them next.</p>

<h3>Language Used In This Booklet?</h3>

<p>We've done our best to keep the amount of medical jargon in this booklet to a minimum, however there are some words that we need you to understand so that you can participate fully in your treatment. With this in mind, we're prepared a glossary of useful terms at the back of this booklet.</p>

<h3>We Need Your Help</h3>

<p>We are constantly trying to improve the information we offer to patients and their families/friends. If you get to the end of this booklet and can think of ways it could be improved (maybe there's something that was missing, or wasn't completely clear), please e-mail us at patiented@mskcc.org and we'll incorporate your feedback into the next version.</p>

<h2>Bone Marrow Basics</h2>

<h3>What is Bone Marrow, What Are Stem Cells?</h3>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder:Diagram of the process by which stem cells become blood; marrow->stem cells->differentiated cells. The stock ones available online are not good and we can do better.</p></div>


<p>Bone marrow is a substance found in the spaces in the center of the larger bones in your body; your hip, breastbone and pelvis.</p>

<p>Your bone marrow is where the different types of blood cells are made - including the white blood cells that fight infection, red blood cells that carry oxygen and and platelets that clot to stop you from bleeding.</p>

<p>But, you might ask, how are these blood cells "made"?</p>

<p>Stem cells are immature cells that produce the blood cells in the body. These cells are found in the bone marrow and some also circulate in your blood.</p>

<p>Stem cells can create many copies of themselves - <em>dividing</em> again and again to create more stem cells.</p>

<p>Your stem cells can also follow a path called <em>differentiation</em>, where they change into the different types of blood cells found in your body.</p>

<p>Stem cells are constantly dividing and differentiating in our bone marrow creating new blood cells to replace older cells.</p>

<h3>Why You Need a Transplant</h3>

<p>You may need a transplant for various reasons. <strong>Check: You are in relatively good health and your doctors feel that a stem cell transplant is the best treatment for your disease.</strong> Your type of cancer responds to high doses of chemotherapy, a form of cancer treatment that uses chemicals to kill these rapidly dividing cells.</p>

<p class="invisible remove">One drawback of chemotherapy is that it also kills other types of rapidly dividing cells in your body - including the stem cells that produce your blood.</p>


<p><strong>Find Best Place For: Collecting your stem cells prior to high dose chemotherapy allows us to give larger doses of chemotherapy. We will return your stem cells to you to rescue your blood-forming cells and your immune system from the side effects of chemotherapy.</strong></p>

<p>When you receive chemotherapy to kill the cancerous cells in your body your bone marrow will be wiped out and you will lose the ability to make new blood cells.</p>

<p class="invisible remove">Because you can't make new blood cells, your immune system and your body's ability to renew itself are compromised.</p>


<p>This is why you need a transplant.</p>

<h3>What is an Autologous Transplant?</h3>

<p>Autologous means <em>from yourself</em> - an autologous stem cell transplant (sometimes called a bone marrow transplant, though stem cell transplant is a more accurate term) is a medical procedure where stem cells are collected (also called "harvested") from your body before you receive your chemotherapy.</p>

<p class="note">This might be a good place to introduce the "we can give you higher doses of chemotherapy" paragraph.</p>


<p>These stem cells are stored safely while you receive your chemotherapy, then given back to you. You are literally receiving a transplant from yourself.</p>

<p>An autologous transplant has three key phases:</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of the process of harvesting/collection. Apheresis. </p></div>


<p><strong>Before</strong> - You prepare for your stem cell transplant. You are fitted with a catheter. You receive drugs that stimulate your body to make more stem cells than normal. Your stem cells are harvested from your body and stored. You receive your chemotherapy, called the "conditioning regimen", to kill cancer cells. Your stem cells are also killed and you lose your ability to make new blood cells.</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of chemotherapy being given through the catheter. </p></div>


<p><strong>During</strong> - You have lost your ability to make new blood, so your immune and healing systems are compromised. Your stem cells are taken from storage and re-infused back into your body.</p>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: An image/diagram of the process of engraftment. </p></div>


<p><strong>After</strong> - The re-infused stem cells find their way through your bloodstream to your bones. Over time they take hold in your bones, a process called "engraftment". They begin to divide and create healthy, new blood cells. Your immune and vital systems begin to return.</p>

<p>Each patient's journey is a little different; your medical team will be able to explain your transplant in more detail.</p>

<h3>What is an Outpatient Stem Cell Transplant?</h3>

<p>Until relatively recently stem cell transplants were always done on an inpatient basis; you would live in the hospital during your chemotherapy, transplant and some of your recovery period.</p>

<p>Now, stem cell transplants like yours can be done on an outpatient basis. This means that while you are receiving your treatment, you will stay in a local hotel or apartment. Every day you will come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic for blood work, vital signs, weight and physical examination. You will only be admitted to the hospital for an overnight stay if you develop complications.</p>

<p>Here is a typical timeline for an outpatient transplant:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Day −4:</em> You and your caregiver check into a hotel or apartment close to MSKCC's main campus in Manhattan.</li>
<li><em>Day −3:</em> You and your caregiver come to MSKCC's Interventional Radiology department at main campus where a central venous catheter is inserted in your upper chest wall. You return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.</li>
<li><em>Day −2:</em> You come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic where you receive your chemotherapy. You return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.</li>
<li><em>Day −1:</em> This is a rest day; you remain in your hotel or apartment for the day.</li>
<li><em>Day 0:</em> Transplant day. You come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic where you receive your stem cell transplant. You return to your hotel or apartment in the evening.</li>
<li><em>Day +1 to +12:</em> You will visit the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day to have blood work done, your vital signs checked and a physical examination. You'll also receive hydration, electrolytes and transfusions if necessary. You return to your hotel or apartment every evening.</li>
</ul>


<p>After <em>Day +12</em> your central venous catheter will be removed. If you live within one hour of MSKCC's main campus you can return home. If you live further away you will stay at your local hotel or apartment for a few additional weeks. You will visit the Outpatient BMT Clinic twice a week, instead of every day.</p>

<p>You'll see that the days leading up to your transplant are given minus number; Day −3, Day −2 etc. The day of your transplant is Day 0, and the days that follow are Day +1, Day +2 etc. Your healthcare team will use this format when they explain your transplant to you.</p>

<p class="move invisible">Move: While you are in the outpatient clinic you will be cared for in a private room that has a bed and bathroom. A light breakfast and lunch will be provided for you. There is a communal lounge with coffee and tea for caregivers.</p>


<h2>Your Transplant Team</h2>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Photograph of the outpatient transplant team would work, if printing is not an issue.</p></div>


<p>A team of healthcare professionals from the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service will care for you through all phases of your treatment. Below you'll find a list of the team members and their rolls. You will meet each member of your healthcare team at different times during your treatment.</p>

<p>Your <strong>attending doctor</strong> will be in charge of your care throughout your treatment. Even though one specific doctor will be your primary doctor, you will be cared for by different doctors during your transplant.</p>

<p><strong>Check if this still works:Fellows, nurse practitioners, hospitalists and house staff are also partners in your care.</strong></p>

<p>A <strong>fellow</strong> is a doctor who has completed general training and is receiving additional training in cancer care.</p>

<p>A <strong>nurse practitioner (NP)</strong> is a nurse who has a master's or doctoral degree. The nurse practitioner is licensed to examine you, provide medical treatments and prescribe medications. The NPs will be responsible for your daily care when you come to the Outpatient Clinic.</p>

<p>Your <strong>BMT Nurse Coordinator</strong> will communicate and work with you and your team of doctors to organize all the testing, procedures and consults with other professionals required prior to your transplant. This nurse will also provide you with treatment calendars describing the timeline for your plan of care and education about the pre-transplant process.</p>

<p>A team of <strong>nurses</strong> will provide your day-to-day nursing care. They are registered nurses specially trained in the care of transplant patients.</p>

<p>The <strong>hospitalist</strong> is a doctor who only sees patients while they are in the hospital. At MSKCC a hospitalist is on duty all night.</p>

<p><strong>House staff</strong> are doctors who are completing their residency. They work under the supervision of the fellows and attending doctors.</p>

<p>A <strong>Clinical Pharmacist</strong> who specializes in the care of transplant patients will review your medications with you and your caregiver, teaching you how to take them properly and to inform you of any side effects they may cause. The pharmacist will review your medications frequently with the outpatient team.</p>

<p><strong>Social Workers</strong> are members of the healthcare team who will help you and your family manage the stresses that come with the transplant process. The social workers understand the issues faced by transplant patients and are on hand to listen, offer counseling and refer you or your family to other resources and services as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Counselors</strong> from Patient Financial Services will work with you and your insurance company to determine your transplant benefits. These financial counselors are experienced in the insurance issues faced by transplant patients. Each insurance company and their policies differ, so when your insurance company requires authorization your financial counselor will assist with that process.</p>

<p class="question invisible">What about the BMT Nurse Coordinator or the Transplant Coordinator?</p>


<p>While you are here, you will come to know all of the members of your team.</p>

<h3>Meeting Your Team</h3>

<p>When does it happen: Around Day −30.</p>

<p class="outstanding">To be written</p>


<h3>Choosing Your Caregiver</h3>

<p>One of the most important steps as you prepare for your transplant is choosing your caregiver. This person is usually a family member or a close friend and will be an important part of your healthcare team. Your caregiver will be responsible for a lot of the day to day medical, practical, emotional support you need during your outpatient transplant.</p>

<p>Your caregiver will receive specific instructions from the healthcare team about their responsibilities. Some of these responsibilities include:</p>

<h4>Medical Support</h4>

<ul>
<li>Gathering information from the healthcare team</li>
<li>Caring for your catheter</li>
<li>Making sure you take your medications and keeping a written record of when you take your medications</li>
<li>Taking your temperature every 4 hours while you are awake and keeping a written record of your temperature</li>
<li>Keeping a written record of down how much fluid you drink every day</li>
<li>Noticing any changes in your condition</li>
<li>Telling your healthcare team about any symptoms you may have</li>
<li>Calling for medical help in an emergency</li>
</ul>


<h4>Practical Support</h4>

<ul>
<li>Dealing with financial and insurance issues</li>
<li>Preparing your meals according to a special, low-microbial diet</li>
<li>Bring you to and from the hospital</li>
<li>Maintaining a clean environment in your hotel, apartment or home</li>
<li>Keeping family members and friends up to date about your condition</li>
<li>Managing the number of visitors you have and keeping you away from anyone who is sick</li>
</ul>


<h4>Emotional Support</h4>

<ul>
<li>Paying attention to your moods and feelings</li>
<li>Communicating with you, listening to you</li>
<li>Understanding your needs and your decisions</li>
</ul>


<p class="question invisible"><span class="complete">I would like to write this bullet-point list into more fluid text, is that acceptable?</span> Decision: Yes, re-write.</p>


<h4>Choosing the Right Caregiver</h4>

<p>Being a caregiver is a full-time, 24/7 responsibility and can be tiring, demanding and stressful - especially if your condition, schedule or treatment changes. While you're undergoing your transplant your caregiver will not be able to work. Your caregiver will need to remain with you for most of the day and night (though while you are in the Outpatient BMT clinic your caregiver can take some time for themselves; this is something we strongly recommend).</p>

<p>It is important for your caregiver to maintain a positive attitude, calm demeanor and flexible approach - and to provide you with encouragement. It's important for you to understand that the caregiver role is challenging and that your caregiver might find themselves stressed by the responsibilities.</p>

<p>Take time now to think about who you would like to be your caregiver. It should be somebody you trust who can take the time to care for you and. Your caregiver should be someone who can offer you the practical and emotional support you need.</p>

<h4>Multiple Caregivers</h4>

<p>If there isn't one person who can act as your caregiver then it may be possible for you to have different caregivers scheduled during different times.</p>

<p class="question">Is there anything more we need to say about this?</p>


<div class="outstanding invisible">
#### Resources for Caregivers
Find better wording for this; Talk to your healthcare team about choosing a caregiver, and encourage your caregiver to make use of the many resources provided by MSKCC. We have included useful resources for caregivers at the back of You can learn about them in the Resources section of this guide or by talking with your team.

<div class="outstanding invisible">
### BMT Orientation
To be written. I don't understand how the BMT Orientation works; research and write content. Does the face-to-face BMT orientation still happen?</div>


<h3>Financial Clearance</h3>

<h4>Insurance</h4>

<p class="outstanding">Summarize insurance issues, what the patient needs to do to get clearance. The role of Patient Financial Services. </p>


<h4>Financial Support</h4>

<p class="outstanding">Sources of financial assistance available to patients. What these grants cover, what they don't cover. How to apply. Social work team are going to offer relevant content. </p>


<h3>Pre-Transplant Medical Evaluation</h3>

<p class="feedback remove invisible">Before you receive your chemotherapy or undergo your transplant you will have some tests that will give us a good understanding of your baseline health and organ function.</p>


<p> To prepare for transplant you will need to make several trips to MSKCC. Before you become a transplant candidate your overall physical condition needs to be evaluated. We often refer to this as the "work-up" or "restating" period. During the work-up you will need to have some of all of the following tests done to give us a good understanding of your baseline health and organ function:</p>

<ul>
<li>A chest x-ray - done to ensure your lungs are clear and there is no evidence of a pneumonia or other problems</li>
<li>Blood tests - done to evaluate your baseline kidney and liver function, and to assess your white blood cell, hemoglobin and platelet counts. Your past exposure to certain viruses is also checked.</li>
<li>Urine tests</li>
<li>Electrocardiogram (EKG), echocardiogram (ECHO) or other tests that give information about your heart</li>
<li>Pulmonary function tests (PFT's) - breathing tests that measure lung function</li>
<li>Computerized axial tomography (CT) Scan - an x-ray that provides cross-sectional views and images of soft tissue as well as bone. Some scans use contrast dye that you drink or have injected into your body. Please alert your doctor if you have a known allergy to contrast dye, or seafood or iodine. If you have an allergy you may need to be given steroids to prevent a reaction the dye before your scan.</li>
<li>Positron emission tomography (PET) Scan – a scan used to visualize physiologic function in body areas</li>
<li>Bone marrow aspiration - provides a sample of your bone and bone marrow. A bone marrow aspirate is a small sample of bone marrow usually taken from the back of your hip. Your hip will be numbed and a needle will be inserted into the bone marrow and a small amount of bone marrow liquid will be withdrawn.</li>
<li>Bone marrow biopsy - A bone marrow biopsy will be performed at the same time as your bone marrow aspiration. The biopsy involves collecting a tiny piece of bone for examination. This procedure is done to evaluate how well your bone marrow is producing cells and to check for any sign of cancer in the marrow.</li>
<li>Skeletal survey - An x-ray of the major bones in your body done to check for any signs of disease. This can take a few hours to complete.</li>
</ul>


<p>These tests will be done in the 30 days before your transplant (Day −30 onwards). The BMT Nurse Coordinator will work with you and your caregiver to schedule the tests.</p>

<p>The results of the tests will be used to plan your treatment and adjust it to your specific needs. The tests will help us to identify any changes to your body that occur during or after your treatment.</p>

<p>Your doctor and nurse will explain any other tests that you may need.</p>

<p class="question hidden"><span class="complete">When are these tests done, how are they scheduled? Also, is this list of tests accurate/complete? What about liver function test, biopsies etc.? Also, can we be any more specific about "blood tests" - what sort of blood tests? What is the purpose of the chest x-ray? I'd like to get more detailed, granular with this - this is our one shot to explain their testing.</span> Answer: These tests are part of the pre-transplant evaluation and are scheduled by the BMT Nurse Coordinator. They are done within 30 days prior to the transplant (to get a more complete picture of the patients baseline health and organ function prior to clearing to start high dose chemotherapy). The blood tests are done to evaluate baseline kidney, liver and hematological function (white blood cell, hemoglobin and platelet counts). A baseline chest X-ray is done to ensure the patient has "clear lungs" and no evidence of a pneumonia or other abnormalities.</p>


<h3>Moving into a Nearby Apartment or Hotel</h3>

<p class="question invisible">To be written. How does the patient actually go about getting a space at the Helmsley. Who organizes this?</p>


<p><strong>Reword: The reservation for the Helmsley Hotel is secured by the patient financial services representative and then communicated to the patient by the BMT nurse coordinator.</strong></p>

<h3>Being Fitted with your Central Venous Catheter</h3>

<p>On or before Day −4 you and your caregiver come to MSKCC's Interventional Radiology department at main campus to have a central venous catheter inserted into the wall of your chest.</p>

<h4>What is a Central Venous Catheter? Why Do I Need One?</h4>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: A clear diagram of the central venous catheter.</p></div>


<p>A central venous catheter is a tube inserted into a large vein near your collarbone. On the outside of your body the catheter divides into 2 or 3 smaller tubes called "lumens".</p>

<p>A central venous catheter allows your healthcare team to give you medicine, fluids, electrolytes, blood transfusions and chemotherapy without the need to stick you repeatedly with a needle. Having a catheter will make your treatment much more comfortable.</p>

<p>The catheter will stay in your body throughout your treatment and is usually removed around twelve days after you receive your stem cell transplant.</p>

<h4>Before Your Catheter is Inserted</h4>

<p>Before your catheter is inserted you shouldn't take aspirin, any products that contain aspirin, or vitamin E. You should also tell your doctor if you are taking any blood thinners or any medication for diabetes.</p>

<p class="question invisible">Do we need to state this or is the BMT Outpatient Team monitoring/communicating this?</p>


<p></p>

<p>Call your doctor before your procedure if you develop any illness. This includes a fever, cold, flu, or sore throat.</p>

<p>If you have been told to be on a clear liquid diet you shouldn't eat any solid food after midnight the night before your procedure and you should continue to drink clear liquids up to 2 hours before you arrive at the hospital for your procedure.</p>

<h4>The Day of the Procedure</h4>

<p>Your transplant coordinator will work with you to schedule the insertion of your catheter; it's likely that you'll be asked to report to the Surgical Day Hospital, where the catheter will be inserted, several hours before the procedure takes place. This will allow the medical team to evaluate you and make sure everything is in order before they insert the catheter.</p>

<p>You will probably already be staying in a nearby hotel or apartment. On the morning of the procedure you may shower, but you shouldn't apply any creams or lotions to your body. Take any medications you've been instructed to take.</p>

<p>If you wear contact lenses you should wear glasses on the day you are fitted for your catheter. If you don't own glasses then bring a container for your contact lenses to the hospital with you.</p>

<p>You and your caregiver should leave any valuables or jewelry at home. Bring only your medications and the money you need for the day to the hospital.</p>

<p>Enter the hospital through the main entrance at 1275 York Avenue. Take the M elevators at the top of the escalator to the 2nd floor. As you step off the elevator, enter the double doors to the Surgical Day Hospital. Check in at the desk. Please arrive on time.</p>

<p>In the SDH, you will change into a gown, robe, and slippers. When you are ready, you will be taken to Interventional Radiology.</p>

<h4>The Procedure</h4>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: A diagram or image showing the incision and placement of the catheter. The text is quite intimidating, so it'd be good to show the procedure in reasonable detail to allay fears.</p></div>


<p>The placement of the catheter should take about 30 minutes. First, an IV line will be started and you will be given some medication through the IV line to control pain and any anxiety; the medication will relax you. Your blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and oxygen levels will be monitored during your procedure.</p>

<p>Two areas of your body will be numbed with a local anesthetic. A small incision (surgical cut) will be made near your collarbone, usually at the base of your neck. This incision will be used to gain access to the vein where the catheter will be placed.</p>

<p>A second incision will be made on your chest, under your collarbone. The catheter will be inserted through this small incision and tunneled under your skin to the first incision. The catheter will then be threaded into the vein. You may feel a pulling sensation.</p>

<p>A cuff surrounds part of the catheter that lies in the tunnel. This cuff will become anchored in the tunnel about 3 to 4 weeks after your procedure. It prevents bacteria from entering the tunnel and traveling up to your vein. This decreases your risk of infection and prevents your catheter from falling out.</p>

<p>The incision near your collarbone will be stitched closed. The stitches will be absorbed and will not need to be removed. The outside of your incision will be covered with strips of adhesive tape. Your catheter will be stitched to your skin at the point where it exits your body so that it will stay in position. You will be able to see this thread around your catheter.</p>

<p class="question invisible">How long does the procedure take, does the patient need to recuperate at the SDH afterwards or do they go straight home? Useful to put a sense of time around the procedure.</p>




<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: A diagram or photograph of the catheter in place. </p></div>




<p class="question hidden">Is the person given supplies to take care of their catheter?</p>


<h3>After Your Catheter Has Been Fitted</h3>

<p>After your catheter has been fitted you will be monitored in the Surgical Day Hospital for 2-3 hours before being allowed to return to your hotel or apartment.</p>

<p class="question hidden">I assume that once the catheter has finished the person goes back to their apartment/hotel? Our story needs to travel home with them.</p>


<p><strong>Check: You will need to leave the dressings covering the incision near your collarbone in place and dry for 48 hours. You can remove these dressings after two days and can leave the site of the incision open to the air. The strips of adhesive tape that cover the incision should be left in place until they start to peel off. This should happen about 3 to 5 days after your catheter is fitted.</strong></p>

<p class="question invisible">If the patient gets their catheter on Day-4 and it takes 3-5 days to heal, and weeks to completely anchor in place, doesn't this run into their chemotherapy and transplant (and beyond)? The text in the CVC guide doesn't address this (obviously, as it's a generic guide). Thoughts?</p>


<p>The point where the catheter exits your skin will still need to be covered with a dressing. The stitch at this site keeps your catheter in place until the cuff becomes fully anchored.</p>

<p>If you have discomfort at your incision sites or around the cuff ask your nurse for medication to relieve your pain.</p>

<h4>Taking Care of Your Catheter</h4>

<p>Taking good care of your catheter is important. You are responsible for caring for your catheter when you are away from the hospital or clinic. <strong>Check meaning: While you are undergoing your outpatient stem cell transplant a nurse will assist you with your catheter care.</strong></p>

<p>A nurse will teach you how to care for your catheter. You will learn how to change your dressing while ensuring that it remains free from germs; this is known as "sterile technique". Using sterile technique will minimize your risk for infection. Your caregiver will learn how to change your dressing with you.</p>

<p>To take care of your catheter one of your nurses will give you supplies including clean dressings, gauze pads, lumen caps, tape, clamps and other essentials.</p>

<p class="question invisible">When will a nurse teach you? Which nurse? Where does this happen?</p>


<p>Your catheter should not interfere with your day to day activities as you get ready for your transplant, but you should avoid strenuous activities and contact sports.</p>

<p>Prepare the following emergency kit and keep it with you at all times:</p>

<p class="question invisible">Where do we introduce the caps, clamps - this is the first time they're mentioned. What do they do in the case of an emergency? (This is covered in the full guide)</p>


<ul>
<li>Two catheter caps</li>
<li>One toothless clamp</li>
<li>Alcohol swabs</li>
<li>One roll of 2-inch tape</li>
<li>Two 2x2 gauze pads</li>
<li>Your doctor's office and emergency telephone numbers.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is a summary of the things you'll do on to take care of your catheter:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change the Tegaderm&trade; dressing once a week</li>
<li>Change the caps on the lumens and flush the catheter twice a week</li>
<li>Use the small white clamps on each lumen of the catheter to clamp the catheter closed when it is not in use.</li>
<li>Use a waterproof cover, called an Aquaquard&trade;, over your catheter when showering or bathing</li>
<li>Avoid submerging the catheter in water (e.g. in a swimming pool)</li>
<li>Keep your catheter secure, avoid pulling it or the lumens.</li>
<li>Tape the lumens to your skin, pin them to your clothing, or tape them to your bra if you're a woman.</li>
</ul>


<p class="question invisible">What does this mean: Clamp the catheter when it's not in use</p>


<h4>Problems with your Catheter</h4>

<p>You and your caregiver should be on the look-out for any problems with your catheter. Infection is the most serious complication to watch out for. Look at the catheter site daily. Notify your doctor, NP or nurse if you experience any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Redness, welting and/or drainage (a liquid that can vary in color but may be clear, bloody or green/yellowish) at the exit site.</li>
<li>Pain or tenderness at the exit site</li>
<li>Temperature greater than 100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C.</li>
<li>Flu-like symptoms or chills</li>
</ul>


<p class="feedback remove hidden">If you notice a discharge from your catheter (a liquid that can vary in color but which is likely to be clear, bloody or yellow/green) or if the exit site around the catheter is red, raw, or swollen, call your doctor. These may be signs of infection.</p>




<p class="question invisible">What does "has drainage" mean?</p>


<p>Other complications may be related to the catheter itself. Notify your doctor, NP or nurse if you experience any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>You see a hole or break in the catheter</li>
<li>Swelling in your face, neck or arm on the same side of your body as the catheter</li>
</ul>


<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Clamping the catheter above a leak.</p></div>


<p>If your catheter is leaking at any time, clamp it above the leak. Use the white catheter clamp on the catheter, if possible. Wipe the area that is leaking with an alcohol pad and then cover the leak with tape. Follow the instructions in your BMT Emergency Guide; if it is between 8am and 8pm call the BMT Outpatient Clinic. If it is after 8pm call your attending physician or go directly to the urgent care center.</p>

<p class="question invisible">Who specifically do they call? Call the BMT Outpatient clinic?</p>




<p class="question invisible">I edited "Cover the site with tape" rolling it into the sentence "Wipe the area that is leaking with an alcohol pad and then cover the leak with tape". The word "site" felt ambiguous and my assumption is that we're taking about putting tape over the leak.</p>


<p>Full instructions on how to care for your catheter are included in the <em>Caring for Your Central Venous Catheter</em> guide which is included in the appendices. You should read this guide in full and refer to it when you are changing your dressing or caring for your catheter.</p>

<h3>Mobilization and Harvesting</h3>

<p>In an autologous transplant your stem cells are first mobilized and then harvested (also called "collected") from your body before you receive chemotherapy. They are re-introduced into your body after your chemotherapy; this is your stem cell transplant.</p>

<p class="feedback remove invisible">On or around Day −4 you will be given an injection of a drug that "mobilizes" your stem cells, then those stem cells will be collected or "harvested" from your bloodstream.</p>


<p>Mobilization is the process of increasing the number of stem cells produced by your bone marrow and released into your bloodstream.</p>

<p>Stem cell harvesting is the process of separating whole blood into its major components (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, plasma and stem cells) then then removing just the stem cells.</p>

<h4>Mobilization</h4>

<p>Normally your stem cells live in your bone marrow (though a few circulate in your bloodstream) where they are difficult to access and collect for transplantation.</p>

<p>Because of this, you'll be given injections of a drug called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF). GCSF stimulates your body to make more stem cells than usual and encourages them to move into your bloodstream where they can be collected much more easily. This process is called <em>mobilization</em>. GCSF drugs include filgrastim (Neupogen&reg;), pegfilgrastim (Neulasta&reg;) and plerixafor (Mozobil&reg;).</p>

<p>In most cases GCSF injections are self-administered, that is you will inject yourself with the drug while at home. You will be given the GCSF in pre-filled syringes, which you'll keep in your refrigerator. Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will create a personal <em>Mobilization Calendar</em> for you which will tell you when to give yourself the injections. The number of injections needed will depend on a number of factors, including your weight.</p>

<p>A full guide to giving yourself GCSF injections is covered in the document "Directions for Giving an Injection Below the Skin with Neupogen (Filgrastim) or Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) in a Pre-Filled Syringe" which is in the appendices. Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will talk you through this information as well.</p>

<p>Some patients will not give themselves injections of Neupogen or Neulasta (both types of GCSF), and will instead be given a different type of GCSF called Mozobil. If Mozobil is recommended for you then the injections will be given by a nurse in the BMT clinic.</p>

<p class="question invisible">How many injections, when are the GCSF injections given, by whom, where etc.</p>


<h4>Harvesting of your Stem Cells</h4>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: The harvesting/collection process. Patient connected to apheresis machine.</p></div>


<p>The injections of GCSF into your body will stimulate the growth and mobilization of your stem cells, then they will be harvested. Harvesting is the procedure used to collect some of these stem cells in your blood.</p>

<p><strong>Check: The harvesting procedure is done in the Blood Donor Room</strong>. Your BMT Nurse Coordinator or your doctor will schedule between three and five harvesting sessions to collect enough cells. The process is painless and each session will last three to four hours.</p>

<p>You should eat dairy products or other foods that are rich in calcium the night before and the morning of your appointment. Wear comfortable clothes.</p>

<p>Harvesting will take place while you are lying in a bed or sitting in a reclining chair. A nurse will examine your arms to see if your veins in your arm are in good condition. If they are then the nurse will insert an IV line into your vein and a machine that separates the stem cells from your blood will be connected to your IV line.</p>

<p>If your catheter has already been fitted then it might be used for harvesting instead of an IV line. In this case one of the lumens of your catheter will be connected to the machine that separates the stem cells from your blood.</p>

<p>Blood will be withdrawn through the IV line or catheter and circulated through the machine where your stem cells will be collected. The rest of your blood is returned to you.</p>

<p>If you wish, you will be able to watch TV or read. A family member or friend may sit with you during the procedure started. Since patients sometimes complain of feeling cold during the procedure, blankets will be available.</p>

<p>After your harvesting procedure is done, your catheter will be flushed and recapped. If the veins in your arms were used for the harvesting, a dressing will be applied to prevent bleeding. It should remain in place for at least three hours, but not more than five hours.</p>

<p>Your stem cells will be brought to our stem cell laboratory where they'll be frozen and and stored safely until your transplant day.</p>

<p>After harvesting most patients have no side effects and can resume their regular activities. Call Your Doctor If You:</p>

<ul>
<li>Develop a fever (100.4° F or 38° C) or chills.</li>
<li>Notice any redness, bleeding, drainage, or pain at the catheter or needle insertion site.</li>
</ul>


<p class="question invisible">Where does mobilization/harvesting happen, when etc? I want to put this in the context of the Outpatient BMT process and give clear instructions.</p>


<h3>Conditioning Regimen</h3>

<div class="feedback remove invisible">
### Receiving Your Chemotherapy

* When does it happen: Day −2.

Two days before your transplant you'll receive your chemotherapy. (This process is also called "conditioning" because it conditions, or prepares, your body for transplant). Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will work with you to schedule and explain your day of chemotherapy. 

You'll be treated with a chemotherapy drug called Melphalan. Information about Melphalan, including its side effects, is included in the appendices.

This will be a busy day. Not only will you receive your chemotherapy, but you'll also meet your Clinical Pharmacist who will review your medications with you and show you how to use your pill box. You and your caregiver will also be given a lot of information about the rest of your treatment and what to expect - some of this information will be on paper and some of it will be verbal. Your caregiver might like to bring a notebook and pen to the clinic to note down key points and any questions.
</div>


<p>Conditioning regimen is another name for the high dose chemotherapy that you will receive prior to the transplant. The specific regimen you receive will depend upon your disease, previous treatments and your specific transplant protocol of treatment plan.</p>

<p>The conditioning regiment starts on a negative numbered day. For example, if you are receiving on single dose of chemotherapy your chemotherapy would start on day -2. Your stem cell transplant always takes place on Day 0. Every day after transplant is referred to as a positive numbered day.</p>

<table>
<tr><th class="tfive">Day -2</th><th class="tfive">Day -1</th><th class="tfive">Day 0</th><th class="tfive">Day +1</th></tr>
<tr><td>Conditioning Regimen (chemotherapy)</td><td>Rest Day</td><td>Stem Cell Infusion</td><td>Start of Supportive Care</td></tr>
</table>


<p>Your physician and BMT Nurse Coordinator will discuss your treatment plan with you.</p>

<p>Your BMT Nurse Coordinator will work with you to plan your schedule and will provide you with a treatment calendar. The BMT Nurse Coordinator will tell you the date, time and location to report to for treatment.</p>

<div class="feedback remove invisible">
#### The Morning before Chemotherapy
</div>


<h4>Outpatient BMT Clinic</h4>

<p><strong>Fit: You will receive all your care in the outpatient BMT clinic on a daily basis. If at any time you need more care than can be provided to you in the outpatient clinic you will be admitted to the inpatient BMT unit.</strong></p>

<p>On the first day of your treatment you and your caregiver should come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic at MSKCC's main campus at 8am. You should wear comfortable, loose everyday clothes - loose fitting tops or shirts that open to the front (so that we can access your catheter), comfortable pants (sweat pants or track suit). You can expect to be in the BMT Clinic for 6 to 10 hours, so you might want to bring newspapers, books, a laptop or tablet computer - things to pass the time.</p>

<p>Once you arrive at the BMT Outpatient Clinic You will be brought to your own private room. A nurse practitioner will review your medical history and ask you a set of questions about how you're feeling. Your vital signs will be checked and you will be weighed.</p>

<p>Once you have been fully evaluated you will meet with the Clinical Pharmacist. The Pharmacist will explain the medications you will take throughout your treatment. You will be provided with all the medications needed. You will be given a medication list to follow.</p>

<p>Some of your medications will be "self-administered" in that you and your caregiver will manage them. You'll take your self-administered medications on a regular schedule or as needed. The Pharmacist will give you a a medication box (also called a pill box) that you'll use to store and manage your self-administered medications. The pharmacist will explain how to use and refill the pill box.</p>

<p>Since you will be at the outpatient BMT clinic for several hours daily you will be provided with meals.</p>

<p class="question hidden">Could you walk me through what happens here in detail? They arrive, who do they meet, where do they go etc.</p>


<h4>Receiving Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>Once you have been evaluated and the Pharmacist has talked through your medications<span class="feedback remove invisible">, you'll be brought to a nearby chemotherapy suite where</span> you'll receive your chemotherapy.<span class="feedback remove invisible">You are free to bring newspapers, books, your tablet or computer with you.</span></p>

<p>Before you receive your chemotherapy it goes through a number of safety checks to make sure everything is correct.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your chemotherapy is ordered by your doctor</li>
<li>A nurse checks your chemotherapy order</li>
<li>A pharmacist checks your chemotherapy order</li>
<li>A pharmacist checks your blood test results</li>
<li>Your chemotherapy is prepared in the Pharmacy</li>
<li>A pharmacist performs a comprehensive final check of your chemotherapy</li>
<li>Your chemotherapy is picked up by your chemotherapy nurse</li>
<li>2 chemotherapy nurses check to make sure your chemotherapy order, blood test results, and chemotherapy are correct</li>
</ul>


<p>Once all the safety checks have been complete the nurse will administer fluids (to keep you hydrated), anti-nausea medication and the chemotherapy drug through your catheter.</p>

<p class="question invisible">How long does this take? Can the caregiver remain with the patient?</p>


<div class="feedback remove invisible">
#### During your Chemotherapy

Your chemotherapy will take several hours to administer, so you will be provided with meals.</div>


<p></p>

<p>During your chemotherapy your healthcare team will use this time to talk to you about the rest of your transplant journey.</p>

<p>The healthcare team will make sure that the logistics of the next few days are clear - what happens on transplant day and what happens after your transplant.</p>

<p>They will talk to you about the side effects you'll start to experience after your chemotherapy. You'll be given printed materials that explain these side effects in detail and you'll be shown what to do if you need to get help while you are in your apartment/hotel.</p>

<p>You will be introduced to the "Patient Temperature and Oral Intake Diary" that you and your caregiver will use to record your temperature and hydration every four hours while you are awake.</p>

<p>You will be given a digital thermometer and instructed on how to take your temperature.</p>

<p>You and your caregiver should use the day of chemotherapy to ask as many questions as possible; make sure you are absolutely satisfied that you have all the information you need. Your healthcare team will do everything they can to answer your questions.</p>

<div class="feedback remove invisible">
#### After Chemotherapy
</div>


<p>When you finish your treatment you will return home to your apartment or hotel. <span class="feedback invisible remove">You will rest for one day before your transplant.</span></p>

<p class="move invisible">Move this or rewrite: During this period your blood cell counts will be very low. You will be at high risk for infection until your bone marrow begins to make new blood cells. To reduce the risk, everyone who enters your room will follow special rules. Your doctor and nurse will explain these in detail.</p>


<h4>Side Effects of Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>Your chemotherapy will kill the cancerous cells in your body and will prepare your bone marrow to receive your transplant. However, the side effects associated with chemotherapy are not to be taken lightly. These side effects will include the loss of your ability to heal and fight infections, infertility, hair loss, fatigue, nausea, mouth sores and mouth tenderness.</p>

<p>Your healthcare team will help you understand and prepare for these side effects. Before you receive your chemotherapy make a list of questions that you would like to ask about these side effects. Talk through these questions with your caregiver and your healthcare team.</p>

<p class="question invisible">What about peripheral neuropathy?</p>


<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Neutropenia and Low Platelet Level</h4>

<p>Your chemotherapy will severely damage your ability to fight infections and heal - it's important that you understand why this happens, how to watch for danger signs, and how to avoid infections and injuries.</p>

<p>One debilitating side effect of chemotherapy is called "<strong>neutropenia</strong>". Neutropenia is a condition where you have a a lower than normal number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in your bloodstream. Neutrophils play a crucial role in your immune system - they are one of the first types of cells that travel to the site of an infection. Once they reach the site of an infection they ingest and fight potentially harmful microorganisms.</p>

<p>Because your chemotherapy will kill your stem cells, you lose the ability to make new neutrophils. Because your neutrophils are not being replaced in your body, in the days after your chemotherapy the number of neutrophils in your bloodstream will drop to a very low level, leaving you vulnerable to infections. You and your caregiver will work together to watch for any sign of infection. You'll keep a regular record of your temperature <span class="feedback remove invisible">and other vital signs,</span> even when you are in your hotel or apartment and you will have to take very careful precautions to avoid infections.</p>

<p>As well as losing your ability to make neutrophils and other types of white blood cells, you'll also lose your ability to make <strong>platelets</strong>. Platelets are little fragments of larger cells made in your bone marrow; they break off from these larger cells and flow through your bloodstream - living for just a few days before being replaced. They clump together to help stop bleeding. Because you will have a very low platelet count after your chemotherapy you will take special care to avoid cuts and strenuous activities that might cause bleeding. You'll take special care of your gums and mouth, because it's quite common for bleeding to start here.</p>

<p>After your transplant your healthcare team will <span class="feedback remove invisible">regularly</span> take samples of your blood each day to count the number of neutrophils and platelets in your bloodstream.</p>

<p>As your stem cells take hold and start to make new blood cells the number of neutrophils in your bloodstream (sometimes referred to as your Absolute Neutrophil Count or ANC) will increase, as will your number of platelets (called your platelet count) - these are collectively known as "your counts" and they are key signs that your transplant has worked. You'll hear the term "counts" used frequently by your healthcare team.</p>

<p>More in-depth guides to living with neutropenia and low platelet levels are included later in this guide under Phase 3: After Your Transplant.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Infertility</h4>

<p>Chemotherapy drugs that kill rapidly-dividing cancer cells will also affect you fertility. It's highly likely that your chemotherapy will mean that you will not be able to conceive a child naturally - if you would like to have children in the future you can make arrangements to have your sperm or eggs frozen before your chemotherapy. Collecting and freezing sperm before your chemotherapy will enable you and your partner to attempt pregnancy when you are ready.</p>

<p>The first step is to schedule an appointment with a reproductive endocrinologist. Reproductive endocrinologists are doctors with special training in fertility and reproductive health. The reproductive endocrinologist will evaluate your fertility and will give you advice on how best to proceed.</p>

<p>It's also very important that you speak to your insurance company. They will tell you if the costs associated with infertility treatment are covered under your policy. Even if your insurance does not cover infertility there may be other programs or grants that can help you pay for your infertility treatment. These are described in the Fertility and Cancer Treatment guides which are included in the appendices.</p>

<p>Typically <strong>men</strong> who want to have children after their chemotherapy opt to have their sperm collected and frozen, this is called sperm banking.</p>

<p>If you are a man and wish to donate sperm you will travel to a sperm bank facility between one and three times. At the sperm bank you will ejaculate into a cup. The sperm bank will analyze the semen, counting the number of sperm. They will also study the shape of your sperm and their motility (ability to swim). If the sperm look healthy, the sperm bank will divide the specimen into small vials and freeze and store them.</p>

<p>Sperm can be stored for as long as is necessary and a yearly storage fee will apply.</p>

<p><strong>Women</strong> who want to have children after their chemotherapy can have eggs or fertilized embryos collected and stored beforehand.</p>

<p>If you are a woman and wish to store your eggs or embryos for future fertilization, first the reproductive endocrinologist will examine you and review your medical history before discussing your options.</p>

<p>If banking your eggs or embryos is an option and you decide to proceed on or around the first day of your period you will start giving yourself daily hormone injections. This medicine will stimulate your ovaries to make more eggs than usual. You will continue this for one to two weeks.</p>

<p>While you are taking the daily injections, you will see your reproductive endocrinologist every day or every other day for blood tests and transvaginal ultrasounds.</p>

<p>Once you have enough mature eggs, you will give yourself a different injection to stimulate ovulation. Within 36 hours you will have an egg retrieval. The egg retrieval is an outpatient procedure done using anesthesia - you will be asleep and no surgical incision is needed. The eggs are collected using a very thin needle that is passed through your vagina.</p>

<p>From this point it's possible to fertilize your eggs with sperm and freeze the resulting embryos. This is called embryo cryopreservation.</p>

<p>An alternative to embryo cryopreservation is egg (oocyte) cryopreservation. This involves freezing eggs that have not been fertilized. When you are ready to use them, the eggs are thawed and fertilized with sperm. This is a newer technology and is still considered experimental but may be preferred by women who do not have a male partner during this time.</p>

<p>Whether you decide to freeze embryos or eggs, they will be stored at an egg bank until you are ready and you have been medically cleared to start a family. A yearly storage fee will apply.</p>

<p>For more detailed information about infertility associated with cancer treatment and your options you should consult the Fertility and Cancer Treatment guides included in the appendices. These guides also list reproductive endocrinologists in the area. You should also talk with your bone marrow transplant doctor about options to preserve your fertility.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Hair Loss</h4>

<p>The chemotherapy that kills your rapidly-dividing cancer cells also kills the rapidly-dividing cells that produce your hair. Most patients will lose their hair during their transplant.</p>

<p>Losing your hair can be an unpleasant, upsetting experience. Like many patients, you might choose to cut your hair short before your transplant to take control of this process and to lessen the shock of losing your hair. Talk this through with your caregiver, friends and family.</p>

<p>Before your transplant is also a good time to think about whether you would like to wear a wig. Modern wigs can look very natural and wearing one might make you feel more comfortable. There are many wig stores in New York, a list of them is provided in the appendices. You can one while you still have your hair, or with a clipping of your hair, if you'd like your wig to match your natural hair.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Fatigue</h4>

<p>After your chemotherapy the number of red blood cells (RBCs) in your blood will be very low.</p>

<p>Red blood cells are the cells that transport oxygen around your body. Because the number of red blood cells in your blood will be low, oxygen will not travel around your body as easily as before. This will mean that you will feel tired. Your caregiver will need to help you carry out day to day activities until your red blood cell count returns to normal. Don't be afraid to ask for help, even with things you used to do with ease.</p>

<p>Even though you will feel tired after your chemotherapy and your transplant, you should still try to remain active - we have recommended some exercises and activities that you can do in section three.</p>

<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - Nausea</h4>

<p class="outstanding">To be written</p>


<h4>Side Effects from Chemotherapy - The Importance of Communication</h4>

<p>Throughout your treatment it's very important that you communicate clearly with your healthcare team and your caregiver about your side effects.</p>

<p>Tell your healthcare team how you're feeling. Describe how your body feels. Describe how you're doing emotionally. Tell them if anything is worrying you. If you notice changes in how you feel describe what has changed. If anything bothers you, even if it seems minor, tell your healthcare team. The more information you can communicate to your healthcare team the more they'll be able to help you. There is usually something that they can do to make you feel more comfortable.</p>

<h3>Rest Day</h3>

<p>The day after you receive your chemotherapy is a rest day. This rest day allows the chemotherapy drug to work and then leave your body. When you receive your stem cells there will be no trace of the chemotherapy drug in your body, so the transplanted stem cells will not be harmed.</p>

<h4>Monitoring Temperature and Fluid Intake</h4>

<p>From now on your caregiver must take your temperature every four hours and write it in the "Temperature and Oral Intake Diary".</p>

<p class="question">Where does the caregiver get the thermometer from?</p>


<p>If your temperature is 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher your caregiver needs follow the instructions on your BMT Emergency Guide; if it is between 8am and 8pm call the BMT Outpatient Clinic at (212) 639-2399. If it is after 8pm call (212) 639-2000 and ask for the doctor covering bone marrow transplant.</p>

<p>It's really important that you drink a lot of fluids from now on. As well as taking your temperature your caregiver will also monitor all of the fluids you drink and record the volume you drink in the Intake Diary. You should drink 2 liters or 64 fluid ounces of fluids each day. Try to drink steadily throughout the day; little and often.</p>

<p>Your caregiver should bring the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary to the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day. A nurse practitioner will review the diary with you.</p>

<p class="question invisible">Do we need to describe what should happen on the rest day? Has the caregiver already been monitoring the patient's vitals and fluid intake, or is this the first day?</p>


<h3>Other Things to Consider in Phase 1</h3>

<p class="outstanding">Need to bring the childcare, pets, exercise, emotional support in here. Need input from the Social Work team; this is pending. They are aware that I need content.</p>


<h3>Checklist</h3>

<p>Before your outpatient treatment starts, there are a number of arrangements to make and options to consider. Use this checklist to keep track of things you need to do before your transplant.</p>

<ul>
<li>Read this guide in full at least once, along with the accompanying appendices and guides. Make note of anything that isn't clear, isn't answered, and any other questions you have.</li>
<li>Meet with the representative from Patient Financial Services (PFS) and talk to your health insurance company. Check your coverage for an outpatient bone marrow transplant and your prescription drug coverage.</li>
<li>Choose a caregiver and make sure they understand what the role entails.</li>
<li>Give your caregiver a copy of this guide and ask them to read it in full at least once</li>
<li>Attend the online orientation for Outpatient Autologous Stem Cell Transplant patients. Ask your BMT Nurse Coordinator for details.
<span class="feedback remove invisible">* Arrange lodging in a hotel or apartment near MSKCC</span></li>
<li>Arrange transportation to bring you from your home to your lodging</li>
<li>If you have children, arrange for childcare</li>
<li>Arrange for pet care
<span class="feedback invisible remove">* Purchase a thermometer and ensure your caregiver knows how to accurately take your temperature with it</span></li>
<li>Make an appointment with a fertility specialist to discuss the impact of your treatment on your ability to have children in the future.</li>
<li>Think about whether you'd like to cut your hair</li>
<li>Visit a wig store if you decide to wear a wig</li>
<li>Purchase a tote bag or rolling bag to carry your supplies to clinic every day</li>
<li>Make a list of questions that you would like to ask about the your treatment.</li>
<li>Talk through your list of questions with your caregiver and your healthcare team</li>
</ul>


<p class="outstanding">This will be a checkable list - circles where the patient and the caregiver can check-off items. We need to validate this list and add anything else we think is relevant.</p>




<div class="phasedivider">End of Phase Divider</div>


<h2>Phase 2 - Your Transplant</h2>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Diagram of the transplant process/timeline with a "you are here" marker on Phase Two, or highlighting of some kind.</p></div>


<h3>One Page Summary of This Phase</h3>

<p>Phase 2 of your treatment last just one day. On Day 0, your transplant day, your stem cells will be taken from storage and infused into your body through your catheter.</p>

<p>These are the key things that will happen during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stem Cells Retrieved - Your stem cells will be taken from storage and thawed.</li>
<li>Transplantation - Your stem cells will be infused into your body through your catheter.</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these activities in detail later in this section.</p>

<h4>Topics</h4>

<p>It's also important that you know about these topics during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Topic 1</li>
<li>Topic 2</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these topics in detail later in this section.</p>

<p class="question invisible">It probably makes more sense to speak about living with neutropenia, monitoring symptoms, infection control in phase three. This is such a short phase that there may be no other topics worth adding into this section. TBD. </p>


<h4>Actions - Things You Need to Do</h4>

<p>At the end of this chapter you'll find a list of things we need you to do during this phase of your treatment. Read this section in full then start to work your way through this list of actions.</p>

<h3>Transplant Day</h3>

<p>Now that you've received chemotherapy to kill the cancer cells in your body, it's time for your transplant. You will be given your infusion of stem cells, your transplant, on Day 0 of your specific treatment plan. The stem cells that were separated from your blood and frozen earlier will be re-infused into your body. These stem cells will give you back your ability to make new blood cells and fight infections.</p>

<h4>The Morning Before Transplant</h4>

<p>On the morning of Day 0, your transplant day, you and your caregiver should come to the Outpatient BMT Clinic at MSKCC's main campus at 8am. Give yourself extra time to get to the clinic, as you may feel tired after your chemotherapy. Bring newspapers, books, a laptop or tablet computer to pass the time.</p>

<p>Once you arrive at the BMT Outpatient Clinic a nurse practitioner will review ask you a set of questions and review your Patient Temperature and Oral Intake Diary. You will be brought to a private room for a physical exam and your vital signs will be checked.</p>

<p class="question invisible">I'd like to get a clear picture of what exactly happens when the patient gets to the clinic. </p>


<h4>The Transplant</h4>

<p>Before your transplant, your frozen stem cells will be removed from storage in the stem cell laboratory <span class="feedback remove invisible">at our blood bank</span> and brought to your room. The stem cells are stored in clear plastic bags that look like a bag of blood. The bags will be placed in a warm water bath to thaw.</p>

<p>Once the stem cells are thawed, the nurse practitioner or doctor will infuse the stem cells into your body through your catheter. You will be closely observed and your vital signs will be checked frequently during and after the infusion.</p>

<p><strong>Check meaning: The potential reactions that occur are caused by the preservative used to protect the stem cells during freezing.</strong></p>

<p class="question invisible">How long does the transplant (the infusion of the stem cells) take from start to finish?</p>


<p>You will be given some medicine about 30 minutes before your transplant to help reduce any side effects effects that you may experience during the infusion. The common side effects are nausea, vomiting, a tickle in your throat, or a cough. It's important that you communicate with the healthcare team and with your caregiver during your transplant. Let your healthcare team know how you're feeling and tell them if you have any side effects.</p>

<p>During and after your transplant you may notice a strong, garlic-like taste in your mouth. Your urine, sweat, and skin may also have a garlic-like smell. This is caused by the preservative used to store your stem cells. The smell will gradually go away over 1 to 2 days. The Nutrition Department can give you lemons to cut up and use as safe, natural air-fresheners.</p>

<p>You may not notice the smell but those around you will. Your urine may appear bloody for 24 hours after your stem cells are infused into your body. This is your body's way of getting rid of the byproducts of the stem cells that are not needed.</p>

<p class="question invisible">I just want to validate that the small could be present during *and* after the transplant. Also, when it's mentioned that "The Nutrition Department will provide lemons" - how is it envisaged that the lemons are used. Cut them, leave them around? Why lemons, because they're natural, non-chemical, non-toxic?</p>


<h4>Engraftment</h4>

<p>Almost immediately after your stem cells are infused into your body they will travel through your bloodstream into your bone marrow.</p>

<p>Once the stem cells arrive in your bone marrow they begin to "engraft". Engraftment is when your body accepts the transplant and your white blood cell count returns. White blood cell engraftment usually occurs about 10-14 days following your transplant, but this may vary depending upon your disease and exact treatment. Platelets and red blood cells usually take a little longer to recover than white blood cells.</p>

<p>The Chemotherapy you received add all your blood cells. During the time that you are waiting for engraftment you may need to have blood and platelet transfusions. You'll be given injections of growth factor - drugs that will speed up the production of white blood cells in your body.</p>

<p>Remember, you are very vulnerable to infection at this time. You will be closely monitored for any signs of infections. Your best defense against infection is hand washing. When your cells start to engraft you mary experience bone pain or a rash on your body. These are common symptoms experienced during engraftment.</p>

<p>They'll begin to divide and differentiate, creating more stem cells and making the different components of your blood including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.</p>

<h4>After Your Transplant</h4>

<p class="question invisible">What happens directly after the transplant? I'd like to travel with the patient from the room where they receive their transplant to their hotel/apartment.</p>


<p>After your stem cells are infused through your catheter you will remain in your hospital room for 2-3 hours for observation. After that you will be allowed to return home to your hotel or apartment to rest.</p>

<h3>Other Things to Consider in Phase 2</h3>

<p class="question">I don't believe there are any in-depth topics to add in here. Probably best to talk about living with neutropenia, low platelet count, diet etc. in the next phase. Happy to add supplementary information to the transplant here though - suggestions welcome. </p>


<h3>Checklist</h3>

<p class="outstanding">This will be a checkable list - circles where the patient and the caregiver can check-off items. We need to validate this list and add anything else we think is relevant.</p>


<h2>Phase 3 - After Your Transplant</h2>

<div class="image-placeholder"><p>Image Placeholder: Diagram of the transplant process/timeline with a "you are here" marker on Phase Three, or highlighting of some kind.</p></div>


<h3>One Page Summary of This Phase</h3>

<p>Now that you've had your transplant, you enter a period of watching and waiting for engraftment to occur. As engraftment occurs the number of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets in your blood will return to normal - the amount of these cells, called your "counts", will be monitored daily.</p>

<p>After your transplant you will remain in a nearby apartment or hotel and will return to the BMT Clinic each day to have your progress evaluated and to have adjustments made to your treatment.</p>

<p>These are the key things that will happen during this phase:</p>

<p class="outstanding">To be written</p>


<p>We cover each of these activities in detail later in this section.</p>

<h4>Topics</h4>

<p>It's also important that you know about these topics during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li>Topic 1</li>
<li>Topic 2</li>
</ul>


<p>We cover each of these topics in detail later in this section.</p>

<h4>Actions - Things You Need to Do</h4>

<p>At the end of this chapter you'll find a list of things we need you to do during this phase of your treatment. Read this section in full then start to work your way through this list of actions.</p>

<h3>Maintaining the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary</h3>

<p>After your transplant your caregiver must continue to take your temperature every four hours and write it in the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary.</p>

<p>If your temperature is 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or higher your caregiver needs follow the instructions on your BMT Emergency Guide. Your caregiver will also monitor all of the fluids you drink and record the volume you drink in the Intake Diary. You should drink 2 liters or 64 fluid ounces of fluids each day. Try to drink steadily throughout the day; little and often.</p>

<p>Your caregiver should bring the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary to the Outpatient BMT Clinic each day. A nurse practitioner will review the diary with you.</p>

<h3>Your Daily Visit to the BMT Clinic</h3>

<p>Each morning you will return to the Outpatient BMT Clinic. You should arrive at 8am. You will remain at the clinic for most of the day. Bring newspapers, books, a laptop or tablet computer or other things to pass the time.</p>

<p>When you come to the clinic you should wear every-day, comfortable clothing that allows for easy access to your catheter; shirts that open at the front, sweatshirts, large t-shirts. Nothing that is too difficult to take off or put back on again.</p>

<p>You should bring these items to the clinic with you each day:</p>

<ul>
<li>A list of all prescription and non-prescription medications you are taking with dosages and frequency. This should include vitamins, nutritional supplements, herbal products and over-the-counter drugs.</li>
<li>All the prescription medications you were instructed to take during the bone marrow transplant period.</li>
<li>Your temperature and oral intake record</li>
</ul>


<p>Once you arrive you will check-in. A nurse practitioner will sit with you and your caregiver and you'll be asked a series of questions about how you feel. The nurse practitioner will check the Temperature and Oral Intake Diary.</p>

<p>Once you've checked in, you'll be brought to an examination room where you'll be examined physically and your vital signs will be checked.</p>

<p>Some of your blood will be taken and sent for testing. Your blood will be checked to see how your white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets are recovering. Your blood will also be checked for any signs of infection such as the presence of harmful bacteria or viruses.</p>

<p class="question">Any details we can add here would be great. What happens during clinic visits. If you can bullet I can write up.</p>


<p>Once you've been examined you will wait in the Outpatient BMT Clinic for your test results to return. This can take several hours. This is a good time for your caregiver to take a break; he or she can take some personal time or run errands. You will be safe in the care of the Outpatient BMT team. We highly recommend that caregivers leave the hospital and take this time to unwind.</p>

<p>After several hours, your test results (sometimes referred to as "labs") will come back from the lab. Your healthcare team will analyze the results and will make decisions about your care. The rest of your visit to the Outpatient BMT Clinic that day will depend on the results of your tests.</p>

<p>Here are some things that can happen based on the results of your tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>You could be given fluids to hydrate you</li>
<li>You could be given an infusion of platelets, red blood cells or other blood components</li>
<li>Your medication could be changed</li>
<li>Your treatment could be left as-is</li>
</ul>


<p>All of this will be explained to you. You'll remain in the clinic until any actions the healthcare team have recommended have been completed. Once your healthcare team is happy, you'll be free to leave. You'll return to your apartment or hotel where your caregiver will continue to monitor your temperature and fluid intake.</p>

<p>You'll continue to make daily visits to the clinic until your healthcare team decide that you can come less regularly.</p>

<h3>Living with Neutropenia</h3>

<p>As you know, your chemotherapy will kill not only the cancerous cells in your body, but also healthy stem cells that make the different types of cells in your blood. This is why you received a transplant.</p>

<p>Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, play a crucial role in your immune system. In the days and weeks after your transplant, while your transplanted stem cells are still engrafting, you will have a very low number of neutrophils in your bloodstream. This will leave you highly susceptible to infections.</p>

<p>You and your caregiver will take careful precautions to avoid infections while you are "neutropenic". These precautions will include eating a special, low-microbial diet (a diet that contains a low number of potentially harmful microorganisms), washing carefully, taking care of your mouth and other precautions.</p>

<h4>Avoiding Sources of Infection</h4>

<p>One of the best ways to avoid infection is to simply avoid sources of infection. This is easier said than done - you and your caregiver will need to be careful about seeing visitors, what you touch, where you go. While you are neutropenic you should try to avoid:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shaking hands with people. When you do shake hands with people use an antibacterial gel, such as Purell&reg; afterwards</li>
<li>Contact with young children, including your children if they are under 12</li>
<li>Contact with animals, including your pets - they cannot stay with you during your transplant</li>
<li>Contact with soil or dirt - you should not keep any plants in your hotel or apartment and should not accept gifts of flowers or plants</li>
<li>Contact with people who have had colds or recent illnesses</li>
</ul>


<p>Telling people who love you and want to make sure that you're okay that you can't see them can be difficult, but you and your caregiver need to be vigilant. You can explain to them that it's just for a short period of time, and that by taking these precautions you are making sure that you can see them as soon as possible. They will understand.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you use a computer or tablet and programs like Skype, Google Talk/Hangouts, FaceTime to keep in touch with friends and family when you are neutropenic.</p>

<h4>Connecting with Children</h4>

<p>Children under 12 are not able to visit you during your transplant period because of the risk of infection. This separation will be difficult for you, your child, and the rest of your family. We know from past experience that patients with children experience a range of feelings and reactions related to this separation.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you take time to talk to one of the social workers about being separated from your children. You or your caregiver should ask your doctor, BMT Nurse Coordinator or any member of the healthcare team that you'd like to speak with one of the social workers and they will make sure to come and see you.</p>

<p>Here are some things that other patients have done to remain in contact with their children during their transplant.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a computer or tablet and programs like Skype, Google Talk/Hangouts, FaceTime to talk to your children regularly. Set up a time that you talk to them each day - like when they get home from school and before they go to bed. Get into a routine of using the computer to see them and talk to them.</li>
<li>Paint or create other crafts to send home. Craft supplies can be provided to you by the Patient Recreation Center. Ask one of your healthcare team to arrange for the Patient Recreation Center to bring supplies to you.</li>
<li>Use your phone to make an audio recording of yourself as you read your children's favorite stories. Upload these recordings to the web, give them to your caregiver, or e-mail them to your children. They can read along with these stories while listening to your voice.</li>
<li>Keep copies of your children's favorite stories with you in your apartment or hotel. At night you can use Skype to read along with them before they go to sleep.</li>
<li>Ask your children to decorate your apartment or hotel with pictures; your caregiver can bring them to you and you can show them hanging on the wall to your children over Skype.</li>
<li>Give your child a special coloring book or journal for times when they miss you are feelings are difficult. Your caregiver can bring the colorings to you. You can talk to your child about them over Skype or the phone.</li>
</ul>


<p>We understand that nothing will replace physical contact between you and your children, but we strongly encourage you to use all available technology and means at your disposal to maintain a strong bond with them while you are unable to see them due to your neutropenia.</p>

<h4>Showering and Bathing</h4>

<p>While you are neutropenic you keeping yourself clean is very important.</p>

<p>You should shower or bathe daily. When you shower or bathe you should use soap that can kill germs. Look for the words "antibacterial" or "antimicrobial". Dial&reg; is one example, but there are many others.</p>

<p>When you shower or bathe take extra care to make sure you wash yourself thoroughly. Begin with your upper body, then the middle section, and wash the lower area including your feet last. Wash carefully under your arms, in your anal and genital areas, and in any skin folds. Germs tend to live in these moist areas. You may shampoo your scalp with soap once a day.</p>

<p>After you urinate or move your bowels, wash your buttocks and genital area with antibacterial soap. You can also use moist wipes. Pat the area dry. Wash your hands well afterward.</p>

<p>When you wash or bathe take care of your catheter; detailed instructions on how to protect your catheter against water are in the appendices.</p>

<p class="question">Can the person use a razor or must they use an electric razor/shaver? Can the person use tampons - there's a general lack of information about what women do during their period. If you can bullet-point the key points I can write up.</p>


<h4>Mouth Care</h4>

<p>While you're neutropenic and have a low platelet count you will need to change the way you brush your teeth and care for your mouth. This will help to avoid infection and bleeding.</p>

<p>Follow these guidelines to take good care of your mouth:</p>

<ul>
<li>You will be given a mouthwash to rinse your mouth before and after meals and at bedtime. The number of rinses may be increased to every 2 hours, depending on how your mouth feels.</li>
<li>Use only the mouthwash that your nurse gives you. Do not use mouthwash or toothpaste from any store. These products irritate and dry the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat.</li>
<li>Use an ultra soft toothbrush. You may also use Toothettes&reg; disposable foam sticks.</li>
<li>Do not use dental floss.</li>
<li>Avoid licking your lips. It increases drying and chapping.</li>
<li>Apply a lubricant like Chapstick &reg; after you clean or rinse your mouth and every 2 to 4 hours as needed. This will help keep your lips moist.</li>
<li>To avoid an infection in your mouth, the doctor will prescribe an oral anti-fungal antibiotic.</li>
<li>If your mouth becomes sensitive, avoid hot, spicy, acidic, or coarse foods. You may prefer soft or liquid food served chilled or at room temperature.</li>
<li>If your mouth feels very painful, your doctor will prescribe medicine for the pain.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Eating a Low-Microbial Diet</h4>

<p>After your chemotherapy, and until told otherwise by your healthcare team, you will need to eat what is called a low-microbial diet. A low microbial diet is a diet that contains fewer microbes (also called microorganisms) than would ordinarily be found in every-day foods. Microbes are tiny living organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, yeast, and molds.</p>

<p>Microbes can attach to foods and grow, but you can't always see, smell, or taste them. They are more likely to grow on milk, unrefrigerated food, undercooked foods, certain fruits and vegetables, unpasteurized juices and vegetable sprouts - but in reality they can grow on any food.</p>

<p>Eating a diet that contains fewer microbes will help you getting sick.</p>

<p>You will need to take careful precautions with the food you eat, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buying foods that you know have been stored properly and are safe to eat</li>
<li>Storing food safely in your hotel or apartment</li>
<li>Keeping your kitchen very clean</li>
<li>Keeping your refrigerator clean</li>
<li>Handling food safely</li>
<li>Eating only food that you know has been prepared and cooked in keeping with a low-microbial diet</li>
<li>Cooking foods thoroughly</li>
</ul>


<p>Refer to the booklet on "Low-microbial diet and safe food handling" in the appendices of this document.</p>

<h3>Living with a Low Platelet Count</h3>

<p>Platelets are little fragments of larger cells made in your bone marrow; they break off from these larger cells and flow through your bloodstream. They clump together to help stop bleeding. Because you will have a very low platelet count after your chemotherapy you and your caregiver will take special precautions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid sharp objects such as a razors, scissors, and nail clippers. You should only shave using an electric razor/shaver and not a razor that has a blade</li>
<li>Do not have manicures, pedicures, waxes, electrolysis or tattoos</li>
<li>Do not have any dental work done</li>
<li>Follow the guidelines on mouth care (above)</li>
<li>Do not use rectal suppositories, enemas, or tampons</li>
<li>Do not take your temperature rectally</li>
<li>Consider using stool softeners or laxatives if you are straining to have bowel movements</li>
<li>Avoid tight clothing or any clothing that you have to strain to put on or take off</li>
</ul>


<p>You should avoid any activity that may result in injury. This includes any:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contact sports</li>
<li>Climbing ladders</li>
<li>Strenuous exercise</li>
<li>Bicycling</li>
<li>Weight lifting</li>
</ul>


<p>You should take precautions when you are having sex. You should use lubrication if needed and avoid anal or oral intercourse. Avoid strong thrusting as this can cause bleeding.</p>

<p class="question">Are these guidelines correct? I had thought that barrier method contraception had to be used as well for BMT patients. These are the generic low platelet guidelines and as such might not cover auto BMT.</p>


<p>You should avoid medications that have not been explicitly prescribed to you by your medical team. Do not take:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aspirin or products that contain aspirin</li>
<li>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Advil&reg;</li>
<li>Vitamin E</li>
</ul>


<p>All of these drugs make it more difficult for your blood to clot and so are very dangerous for somebody like you with a limited ability to heal and clot.</p>

<p>Call your doctor if you develop any symptoms of bleeding. Be on the lookout for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Excessive bruising</li>
<li>A faint red rash on your trunk, arms or legs</li>
<li>Vaginal spotting or heavy menstrual bleeding</li>
<li>The appearance of broken blood vessels in the white of your eye</li>
</ul>


<p>If you notice that you are bleeding you should take these steps immediately:</p>

<ol>
<li>Apply direct pressure on the bleeding site.</li>
<li>After applying pressure, follow the BMT Emergency Guide; if it is between 8am and 8pm call the BMT Outpatient Clinic at (212) 639-2399. If it is after 8pm call (212) 639-2000 and ask for the doctor covering bone marrow transplant.</li>
<li>Apply ice over the bridge of your nose for nosebleeds.</li>
</ol>


<p>Call your doctor immediately if you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have black bowel movements, blood in the stool, or rectal bleeding</li>
<li>Have blood in your urine</li>
<li>Have a headache that do not get better, blurred vision, or dizziness</li>
<li>Cough up blood, vomit blood or get a nose bleeds</li>
</ul>


<h3>Living with a Low Red Blood Cell Count (Anemia)</h3>

<p>Red blood cells carry oxygen to the tissues. We breathe in oxygen from the air and breathe out carbon dioxide. Hemoglobin in red blood cells carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues in all parts of the body. It then carries carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs.</p>

<p>Your chemotherapy will cause you to have a very low red blood cell count, a condition known as anemia. Some of the side effects of anemia are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increased tiredness</li>
<li>Generalized weakness</li>
<li>Rapid heartbeat</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Pale skin</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have anemia, your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A transfusion</li>
<li>Rest</li>
<li>A diet high in iron (e.g., green leafy vegetables, liver, chicken)</li>
<li>Iron supplements</li>
</ul>


<p class="question">I assume that the diet/iron recommendations here don't apply to SCT patients?</p>


<h3>Receiving a Transfusion</h3>

<p>Your doctor may recommend a blood transfusion to boost the number of platelets or red blood cells in your body.</p>

<p>If your doctor recommends a transfusion for you it will be given to you through your catheter during one of your regular visits to the Outpatient BMT Clinic.</p>

<h4>Sourcing Blood for Your Transfusion</h4>

<p>The blood used in your transfusion is donated at our Blood Bank. There is no substitute for real blood, so we are incredibly grateful to the people who donate blood.</p>

<p>Your friends and relatives may donate red blood cells and platelets - this is known as a directed donation. Your friends and relatives are eligible to donate if they:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are between 16 and 75 years old. No parental consent is required for those who are at least 17 years old.</li>
<li>Weigh at least 110 pounds</li>
<li>Are in good health</li>
<li>Have not had an illness such as hepatitis, jaundice, cancer, etc</li>
<li>Do not have signs of a cold or active allergy at the time of donation</li>
<li>Have not taken aspirin, or any compound that has aspirin or aspirin-like drugs (Ibuprofen, Motrin&reg;, Naprosyn&reg;, Anaprox&reg;, Advil&reg;, Aleve&reg;) within three days before giving blood.</li>
<li>Have identification showing their name and photograph or signature</li>
<li>Have not consumed alcohol eight hours before donating</li>
</ul>


<p>Blood donations can be given by appointment at our Blood Donor Room which is located at:</p>

<p>Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
Schwartz Building Lobby
1250 First Avenue
(Between 67th and 68th Streets)
New York, NY 10065</p>

<p>For more information about making a directed donation and to make an appointment, your friends and family should call our Blood Donor Room at 212-639-7643.</p>

<p>If your friend of family member has a blood type that isn't compatible with yours then their blood will be released for use with other patients at MSKCC.</p>

<p>Directed donations will be held for you for 30 days. After that, the blood will be released for use with other patients at MSKCC.</p>

<h4>Making Sure Blood Is Safe</h4>

<p>After it is donated all blood is tested for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Syphilis</li>
<li>Hepatitis B and C</li>
<li>Exposure to the AIDS virus</li>
<li>The presence of a virus associated with a very rare form of leukemia.</li>
<li>West Nile virus</li>
<li>Trypanosoma Cruzi</li>
</ul>


<p>The chance of getting any of these from donated blood is very small. Directed donations are tested in exactly the same way as other donations.</p>

<h4>How long does the Transfusion take?</h4>

<p>A transfusion of red blood cells usually takes two to four hours. Transfusions of other blood components, like platelets, takes only 15-30 minutes.</p>

<h4>Are there risks associated with blood transfusions?</h4>

<p>Yes, blood transfusions have some risks. These risks include the very slight chance of having an allergic reaction or acquiring an infection through tainted blood.</p>

<p class="question">Are these risks worth mentioning?</p>


<h4>Can anything bad happen during or after the transfusion?</h4>

<p>Transfusions sometimes cause reactions. The most common symptoms are fever, chills, and hives. These can be treated with a variety of medicines. Transfusion reactions are rarely life threatening. Nursing staff constantly check all patients while a blood transfusion is taking place.</p>

<h3>Is there anything to worry about after a transfusion?</h3>

<p>Allergic reactions can sometimes occur. Symptoms are listed below. They can occur up to 48 hours after the transfusion. Call your doctor immediately if you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fever (100.4 F or 38 C or higher) or chills.</li>
<li>Flushing of the face.</li>
<li>Hives, rash, or itching.</li>
<li>Trouble breathing or shortness of breath.</li>
<li>Low back pain.</li>
<li>Nausea or vomiting.</li>
<li>Weakness or fainting.</li>
<li>Blood in the urine.</li>
<li>Chest pain (If you have chest pain, call your local emergency number immediately.).</li>
</ul>
