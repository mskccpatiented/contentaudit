<h1>Outpatient Autologous Stem Cell Transplant</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Outpatient Autologous Stem Cell Transplant program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The outpatient center provides a comfortable, convenient, and safe option for your care while receiving your stem cell transplant. The information in this binder will serve as a roadmap throughout the transplant process, outlining what to expect and how to prepare yourself physically and emotionally.</p>

<p>Our goal is to make both you and your caregiver comfortable during your treatment. While you are receiving your outpatient treatment, you will stay in a local hotel or apartment. From there you will come to the outpatient BMT clinic everyday for blood work, vital signs, weight and physical examination. You will also receive your treatment in this area. While you are in
the outpatient clinic you will be cared for in a private room that has a bed and bathroom. A light breakfast and lunch will be provided for the patient. There is a communal lounge with coffee and tea for caregivers. This area has wireless internet available for your use.</p>

<p>At MSKCC, the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service works as a team. Your attending doctor, the one you see in
the clinic, will be in charge of your care throughout your treatment. Fellows, nurse practitioners, hospitalists and house staff are also partners in your care. A fellow is a doctor who has completed general training and is receiving additional training in cancer care. A nurse practitioner is a nurse who has a Master’s
or Doctorate degree. The nurse practitioner
is licensed to examine you, provide medical treatments and prescribe medications. The hospitalist is a doctor who only sees patients while they are in the hospital. At MSKCC a hospitalist is on duty all night. House staff are doctors who are completing their residency. They work under the supervision of the fellows and attending doctors.
A team of nurses will provide your day-to-day nursing care. While you are here, you will come to know all of the members of your team.</p>

<h2>Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant</h2>

<p>Stem cell transplants are used to treat for many forms of cancer. Different types of cancers are treated different types of transplant methods. You will be receiving an autologous bone marrow transplant.</p>

<p>In an autologous stem cell transplant, your own stem cells will be used for your transplant. Your stem cells are collected, stored, then returned to your body after you receive chemotherapy.</p>

<p>Stem cells give rise to all blood cells. Stem
cells either divide to form a new stem cell, or they mature to become a red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet. Your hip, breastbone (sternum), and pelvis contain the largest amount of stem cells, however some circulate in your bloodstream.</p>

<h2>Preparing For Your Transplant</h2>

<p>The information in this section will help you prepare for your autologous stem cell transplant.</p>

<h3>Choosing Your Caregiver</h3>

<p>One of the most important steps as you prepare for your outpatient transplant is choosing your caregiver. Your caregiver will be an important part of your healthcare team. This person is usually a family member or a close friend. You may have just one caregiver during your entire transplant, or you may have different caregivers during different times. It is important to know that while in the role of your caregiver, this person will not be able to work. Your caregiver will be involved in your care throughout your transplant process.</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide emotional support</li>
<li>Provide physical care during and after transplant.</li>
<li>Help with everyday tasks</li>
<li>Care for your central line</li>
<li>Make sure you take your medications</li>
<li>Write down when you take your medications</li>
<li>Take and record your temperature every 4 hours (while you are awake)</li>
<li>Write down how much fluid you drink every day</li>
<li>Notice changes in your condition</li>
<li>Get you medical help in an emergency</li>
<li>Tell your health care team about any symptoms you may have</li>
<li>Gather information from the healthcare team</li>
<li>Keep family members and friends up-to-date about your condition</li>
<li>Help manage the number of visitors you have, keeping you away from anyone who is sick</li>
<li>Prepare your meals according to a special diet</li>
<li>Maintaining a clean environment in your home or place of recovery</li>
<li>Bring you to and from the hospital</li>
</ul>


<p>There are many resources available at MSKCC for patients and caregivers. You can learn about them in the Resources section of this guide or by talking with your team.</p>

<h3>Managing your Emotions</h3>

<p>Learning that you may have a stem cell transplant can be a very emotional time for you and your loved ones, but there are things you can do and ways we can help.
Talk with your transplant team.
Fear of the disease, treatment, and even the unknown are common and normal. You may want to talk with your social worker, doctor, or nurse about your feelings. If you’re feeling anxious or depressed, your doctor may prescribe a medication to help you deal with the stress. There are many resources available to you as a patient at MSKCC; you can find information about them in the Resources section of this guide.
Ask Questions.
Learning about your illness and transplant helps some people decrease fear of the unknown. The transplant process can be overwhelming because many things are happening. By making a list of your worries or questions, you can focus on just a couple of your concerns at a time. Your transplant team expects you to have questions and will answer them.
Share your feelings and thoughts.
Sharing how you feel with others and what you think about your transplant is another way that may decrease the burden. Some patients find this difficult because they don’t want to worry their family and friends. However, not knowing how you feel or how to help may worry them even more. Sharing feelings and thoughts can bring people together at a time of stress. You may also ask your social worker about a support group that may be helpful.</p>

<h3>Fertility</h3>

<p>If your plans after transplant include having children, there are steps you will need to take now. Nearly all patients become infertile (unable to have children naturally) after a stem cell transplant. However, many patients can take steps before transplant to preserve their fertility.</p>

<blockquote><p>Sheila would your preference be to have a male and female version to print out? That way there could be more info under fertility?</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Men can have their sperm collected and frozen (sperm banking)</li>
<li>Women may be able to have their eggs collected. The eggs can be fertilized to create embryos which are then frozen, or the eggs themselves can be frozen.</li>
</ul>


<p>Frozen sperm, embryos, and eggs can be stored for many years. They can be thawed and used in the future, once you are medically cleared and ready to start a family. Talk with your doctor or nurse if you would like more information about options to preserve your fertility.</p>

<h3>Tests and Procedures</h3>

<p>Before you receive your transplant, you will need some medical tests. Some of these tests may have been done already; your your transplant team will tell you which tests are necessary and work with you to schedule them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Chest x-ray</li>
<li>Blood tests
These tests are done to see how well your kidney, liver, and bone marrow are working.</li>
<li>Urine tests
These tests are used to see how your kidneys are working.</li>
<li>Electrocardiogram (EKG)
This test shows the electrical activity of your heart.</li>
<li>Echocardiogram (ECHO)
This test tells how well your heart is functioning.</li>
<li>Pulmonary function test (PFT)
This test determines how well your lungs are working.</li>
<li>Computerized axial tomography (CT) Scan This test is done to look closely at the organs inside your body.</li>
<li>Positron emission tomography (PET) Scan This test is done to look for cancer.</li>
<li>Bone marrow aspiration
A sample of bone marrow will be collected from your hip bone. This test looks at
how well your bone marrow is working and will show if there is any disease present in the marrow.</li>
<li>Skeletal survey
This test is done to see if there is any disease in your bones.</li>
<li>Dental Exam
Any cavities, loose fillings, or gum disease should be taken care of before your transplant. You can have this done by your own dentist or you can see our dentists. If you see your own dentist, please ask him or her to provide a note that you have no dental problems.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p>Being in the best physical health you can before your transplant will help you recover. Before your transplant, work with your doctor and/or physical therapist to develop an exercise plan that’s right for you. Walking or doing some form of exercise every day will help prepare your body for transplant.</p>

<h3>Eating Well</h3>

<p>When preparing for your transplant, eat a well- balanced diet high in protein, vitamins, and minerals. It’s important to be in the best physical health you can be before your transplant because you will have difficulty eating during some periods of time during your transplant.</p>

<h3>Hair Care</h3>

<p>Most patients will lose their hair during transplant, which can be a traumatic experience. Some patients choose to cut their hair short before transplant to lessen the shock of losing their hair. Whether or not you choose to cut your hair, before your transplant is a good time to think about whether you might want a wig. If a wig is something your considering, you may wish to visit a wig store while you still have your hair, or with
a clipping of your hair if you would like the wig
to match your natural hair. There are wig stores in the New York area listed in the Resource section of this guide. Scarves and hats are other accessories that you might consider. Some patients choose not to wear anything at all, or to decide when the time comes.</p>

<h3>Financial and Insurance</h3>

<p>Unwritten.</p>

<h3>Getting More Information</h3>

<p>Different people look for different amounts of information about their cancer treatment. If you would like to know more than what is in this binder, there are a number of ways to get reliable information. Talking to your healthcare team
is the best way to get information about your treatment options. Many people also go to the internet. While the internet is a great resource for information, it is important to go to reliable sources. You can find websites suggested by the MSKCC staff on the LIBGUIDES section on MSKCC’s website at www.mskcc.org. If you prefer, you can call the library reference staff at (212) 639-7439 for assistance finding reliable information.
Many patients find they collect a lot of information as they prepare for their transplant. Use this binder to organize the information in one place and write down any questions for your healthcare team. Remember to bring this binder with you to all your MSKCC appointments.</p>

<h3>Mobilization and Harvesting</h3>

<p>Before your stem cell transplant, your stem cells will be mobilized and harvested.
Stem cells are mostly in the bone marrow, however they can be moved into the bloodstream where they can easily be collected. This movement is called mobilization. You will have injections of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) such as filgrastim (Neupogen&reg;) or plerixafor (Mozobil&reg;) to increase the amount of stem cells
in your bloodstream. The stem cells in your blood are harvested before you are treated with chemotherapy.
Stem cell harvesting is done by a procedure called apheresis, which is very similar to giving blood. You will lie in a chair or bed in the Blood Donor Room for 3 to 4 hours for each collection. Usually between 1 and 5 sessions are required to get enough stem cells to support an autologous stem cell transplant.
The stem cells are collected by a machine that separates them from your blood. Before the procedure, your doctor or nurse will check the veins in your arms. If the veins are not easy to find, an intravenous (IV) catheter (a small flexible tube) may be inserted in a large vein in your neck or chest after a local anesthetic is injected. The catheter can stay in place for many months. It will be used to draw blood or give you chemotherapy after the harvesting. You will also need it for fluids, IV medicines, and blood transfusions. Broviac&reg;, Hickman&reg;, and Quinton&reg; catheters are brands
of long-term IV catheters. The catheter may have 2 or 3 branches called lumens. Wear shirts that button or zip in the front or tops with a low collar so that the catheter can be accessed easily throughout your care. If the veins on your arms are easy to find, you may not need a catheter for the harvest.</p>

<p>Most patients have no side effects after the harvesting, and can go back to their regular activities. After your stem cells are harvested, they are frozen and stored until you need them.</p>

<h3>Checklist</h3>

<p>Before your outpatient treatment starts, there are a number of arrangements to make and options to consider. It’s also helpful to gather items you will need ahead of time. Use this checklist to keep track of things you need to do before your transplant.
Identify a caregiver
Arrange for transportation
Arrange for housing
Arrange for childcare
 Make an appointment with a fertility specialist if your plans include having children
Arrange for pet care
Check your prescription drug coverage
Purchase a tote bag or rolling bag to carry your supplies to clinic every day
Visit a wig store if you decide to wear a wig Attend the outpatient transplant orientation
with the Nurse Practitioner
Add anything else you want to remember here

<h2>During Your Transplant</h2>

<p>Your transplant process begins with <strong>unwritten</strong></p>

<p>￼During the conditioning phase of your transplant, you will receive chemotherapy called melphalan. Using chemotherapy to destroy cancer cells conditions your body to receive the transplant. Information about melphalan, including its side effects, is included in the Medications section of this guide.
Talking with your healthcare team is an important part of controlling and managing any side effects you have from melphalan. Your transplant team will prepare you for any common side effects, but only you can tell when something is bothering you. Tell your transplant team if something is bothering you or doesn’t seem right, even if it seems minor. There are usually things that can be done to help.
When you finish chemotherapy, you will have 1 or 2 days of rest before your transplant. During this period your blood cell counts will be very low. You will be at high risk for infection until your bone marrow begins to make new blood cells. To reduce the risk, everyone who enters your room will follow special rules. Your doctor and nurse will explain these in detail.</p>

<h4>Caring for your Skin</h4>

<p>Keeping yourself clean is very important. You
will have a routine to clean your skin each day with antibacterial soap. Begin with your upper body, then the middle section, and wash the lower area including your feet last. Pay extra attention to washing your underarms, groin, and the area between your genitals and rectum. Germs tend to live in these moist areas. You may shampoo your scalp with ordinary soap once a day.
After you urinate or move your bowels, wash your buttocks and genital area with antibacterial soap. You can also use moist wipes. Pat the area dry. Wash your hands well afterward.
Keep the skin around your IV catheter very clean. The dressing that covers and protects it will be changed weekly, as long as it is dry and covered. To reduce the chance of infection, do not allow the IV tubing to touch the floor.</p>

<h3>Eating Well</h3>

<p>During your transplant, your appetite may decrease. This is expected. You eat and drink
as much as you can without forcing yourself. Nutritional shakes or supplements can be helpful as you go through this period.
Your dietitian and nurse are here to help you when you are not able to eat as you usually do. By the time your treatment is complete, you will be able to drink enough liquids and eat small amounts
of food.</p>

<h3>Caring for your Teeth and Mouth</h3>

<p>It is very important to take good care of your teeth and mouth during your transplant. This will help prevent infections and sores in your mouth. Follow these guidelines:
* You will be given a mouthwash to rinse your mouth before and after meals and at bedtime. The number of rinses may be increased to every 2 hours, depending on how your mouth feels.
* Use only the mouthwash that your nurse gives you. Do not use mouthwash or toothpaste from any store. These products irritate and dry the mucous membranes of the mouth and throat.
* Use an ultra soft toothbrush. You may also use Toothettes&reg; disposable foam sticks.
* Do not use dental floss.
* Avoid licking your lips. It increases drying and chapping.
* Apply a lubricant after mouth care and every 2 to 4 hours as needed. This will help keep your lips moist.
* To avoid an infection in your mouth, the doctor will prescribe an oral antifungal antibiotic.
* If your mouth becomes sensitive, avoid hot, spicy, acidic, or coarse foods. You may prefer soft or liquid food served chilled or at room temperature.
* If your mouth feels very painful, your doctor will prescribe medicine for the pain.</p>

<h3>Low Microbial Diet</h3>

<p><strong>Refer to full Low Micro Diet guide</strong>
This information will help you follow a low microbial diet. Eating a low microbial diet will reduce your risk of getting ill while you have a weakened immune system, such as after chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a bone marrow transplant.
The first section of this booklet has information on how to keep your food safe. The second section explains what foods and beverages are safe to eat while on a low microbial diet. Don’t make any changes to this
diet until you have talked to someone on your healthcare team. This includes your doctor, nurse, nurse practitioner, or dietitian.</p>

<p>Food Safety Guidelines</p>

<h4>What are microbes?</h4>

<p>Microbes are tiny living organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, yeast, and molds. They can get into food by infecting the animal the food comes from. Microbes can also get into food when it is being processed or prepared. When microbes get into foods, they can cause infections, especially if you have a low white blood cell count (neutropenia).
Microbes can attach to foods and grow, but you can’t always see, smell, or taste them. They are more likely to grow on
* Milk and other dairy food items that are not refrigerated
* Undercooked and raw eggs and foods that have raw eggs (e.g., cookie dough and Caesar salad dressing)
* Undercooked or raw meat, poultry (chicken and turkey), and seafood
* Certain fruits and vegetables (see the Fruits and Vegetable list in the “What to Eat on a Low Microbial Diet” section)
* Unpasteurized or untreated juices (e.g., fresh-squeezed juices)
* Vegetable sprouts (e.g., raw alfalfa, soy bean, and radish sprouts)</p>

<h4>Buying foods that are safe to eat</h4>

<ul>
<li>Don’t buy canned foods if the can has dents or is swollen.</li>
<li>Don’t buy food in jars if the jar is cracked or the lid is not tightly closed.</li>
<li>Only buy eggs that are refrigerated in the store. Check the eggs by opening the carton to see if any are broken or cracked.</li>
<li>Separate ready-to-eat and raw foods. Put
raw meat, poultry, seafood, and other raw foods in plastic bags before they go into your shopping cart.</li>
<li>Pick up your milk and other cold foods at the end of your shopping trip. This decreases the time these items will spend outside of the refrigerator.</li>
<li>Check containers for the expiration date. Buy and use food before that date.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Storing food safely</h3>

<ul>
<li>Store food immediately after shopping.</li>
<li>Put eggs and milk inside the refrigerator; don’t store them in the door. The temperature inside the refrigerator will stay cooler than in the door area.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Keeping your kitchen clean</h4>

<ul>
<li>Keep an area of your kitchen clean for preparing and eating food. This will help prevent the spread of microbes.</li>
<li>Use paper towels or clean cloths instead of sponges to clean kitchen surfaces.</li>
<li>Use an antibacterial cleansing spray to clean surfaces. Look for products that have bleach or ammonia. Examples are Lysol® Food Surface Sanitizer and Clorox® Clean-Up® Cleaner.</li>
</ul>


<p>Using cutting boards and equipment
* Use cutting boards that are made out of
thick plastic, marble, glass, or ceramic. These materials are nonporous, meaning that food or liquid substances can’t absorb into them. Avoid using wood or other porous surfaces.
* Wash cutting boards and knives with hot soapy water before using them to cut the next food. As an extra precaution, wash your cutting boards with a kitchen sanitizer. Throw out worn or hard-to-clean cutting boards.</p>

<p>Handling food safely
* Wash your hands thoroughly
– Before preparing or eating food
– After preparing raw poultry, meat, fish, or seafood
– After handling garbage
* Thoroughly rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under running tap water. Rinse skins and rinds before cutting or peeling. Never use bleach or detergent to wash fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>

<ul>
<li>Rub firm-skinned fruits and vegetables under running warm tap water or scrub them with a clean vegetable brush while rinsing with running tap water.</li>
<li>Remove and throw away any damaged or bruised areas on fruits or vegetables.</li>
<li>Cook all foods thoroughly.</li>
<li>Separate raw meats from ready-to-eat foods.</li>
<li>Thaw foods by using only 1 of the following methods:
– Put the food item in the refrigerator 1 day before cooking.
– Use the defrost setting on a microwave. Cook right away.</li>
<li>Keep your refrigerator at a temperature of 33° F to 40° F.</li>
<li>Keep your freezer at a temperature of 0° F or below.</li>
<li>Use a food thermometer to check the temperatures of cooked and reheated foods.</li>
<li>Don’t eat hamburgers and other meat products if the meat looks undercooked. Cook the meat until it is grey and the juices run clear.</li>
<li>Cook fish until it flakes.</li>
<li>Cook egg whites and yolks until they are firm.</li>
<li>Cook all meats to the minimum internal temperatures listed in the chart below.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Transplant Day</h2>

<p>Once the diseased cells and bone marrow are destroyed by chemotherapy, it is time for your transplant, or “rescue”. This is often called “day zero”. Many survivors consider this day their second birthday.</p>

<p>Before your transplant, your frozen stem cells will be removed from storage and brought to your room. The stem cells are stored in clear plastic bags that look like a bag of blood. The bags will be placed in a warm water bath to thaw. Once the stem cells are thawed, the nurse practitioner or doctor will infuse them through your IV catheter.</p>

<p>You may have some side effects during the infusion. The most common ones are nausea, vomiting, a tickle in your throat, and a cough. You will receive medicine about 30 minutes before your transplant to help reduce these side effects.</p>

<p>You may notice a strong, garlic-like taste in your mouth. Your urine, sweat, and skin may also have a garlic-like smell. The Nutrition Department
will provide lemons to reduce the odor. The preservative in the stem cells causes this garlic odor and it will gradually go away over 1 to 2 days.
Almost immediately after they’re infused, your transplanted cells will travel through your bloodstream into your bone marrow. Here, they engraft and begin to make healthy blood cells. As the bone marrow grows, your blood counts will slowly return to normal. This is called bone marrow engraftment.</p>

<p><em>Term: Engraftment is the growth of transplanted stem cells reflected when the blood count return to normal.</em></p>

<h2>After your Autologous stem Cell Transplant</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve had your transplant, you enter a period of watching and waiting for engraftment to occur. Engraftment occurs when the bone marrow begins to form the cells that give rise to mature blood cells. It will first be seen as your white cell count starts to rise. Recovery of the red blood cells occurs more slowly. Platelets tend to recover last.
During this time you will come into the clinic everyday. Your blood will</p>

<p>be taken daily to assess and track your blood cell levels, and your vital signs will continue to be checked frequently. You and/or your caregiver will keep track of how much fluid you drink and your temperature while you are not in the clinic.
After your transplant you’ll need to continue to follow the low microbial diet explained in the During your Stem Cell Transplant section of this guide.</p>

<h3>Checklist</h3>

<p>You must bring the following items to your clinic appointment everyday:
All prescription medications you were instructed to take during the bone marrow transplant period.
Comfortable day clothes – sweat pants, large t-shirts, shirts that open in the front, and shoes with traction like sneakers
Notebook – keep a list of questions for your health care team
Your temperature and oral intake record You may also find it helpful to have the
following items with you in clinic:
A list of all prescription and non- prescription medications you are taking with dosages and frequency. Include vitamins, nutritional supplements, herbal products and over-the-counter drugs.
Lip moisturizer, such as ChapStick® Distractions – books, magazines, music, or
puzzles to help pass the time
Cell phone
Laptop, iPad®, iPod® or other electronic device</p>

<h3>Emotional Support</h3>

<p>Being away from home for a long time, the slow recovery after transplant, and low energy may be frustrating. Dealing with your feelings can help you cope with treatment and feel better. You may want to talk with your social worker, doctor, or nurse about your feelings.</p>

<h3>Connecting with Children</h3>

<p>Children under 12 are not able to visit you during your transplant period because of the risk of infection. This separation may be difficult for you, your child, and the rest of your family. We know from past experience that patients with children experience a range of feelings and reactions related to this separation. To help you, we have created the following tips for helping you and your child stay connected. In addition, your social worker is available to talk with you about your concerns.</p>

<p> Record a song to send home. Ask your nurse for a referral for Music Therapy to help
• Use a webcam to Skype using your computer
• Paint or create other crafts to send home. Supplies are provided by the Patient Recreation Center.
• Write letters, notes, or cards and mail them every few days.
• Give your child a special coloring book or journal for times when they miss you are feelings are difficult. Pictures can be mailed or taken to you by your next visitor.
• Record a video or story read by you that can be played for your child
• Ask your child to help decorate your room by providing drawings every few days.</p>

<h2>Neutropenia (low White Blood Cell Count)</h2>

<p>This information will help you avoid infection while your white blood cell count is low. This is called neutropenia.
Neutrophils are white blood cells (WBC). They help your body fight infections. You must follow the instructions described on this card to prevent infection until your neutrophil count returns to normal. You should also be aware of signs of infection and report them to your doctor or nurse. Be sure to take your temperature orally (by mouth), as directed by your doctor or nurse.</p>

<h3>General Hygiene</h3>

<p>• Shower or bathe daily. Wash carefully under your arms, in the anal and genital areas, and in skin folds.
• Use soap that can kill germs. Look for the words “antibacterial” or “antimicrobial.” Dial® is one example, but there are many others.</p>

<p>• Perform mouth care after each meal. Use an ultra-soft toothbrush and brush and rinse as directed by your doctor or nurse.
• Use antibacterial hand gels (such as Purell®) after shaking hands and after contact with young children.</p>

<p>Steps to Prevent Infection</p>

<p>• Avoid having visitors to your home who have colds or recent infections.
• Hold off on having any dental work or procedure that is not urgent. Speak with your doctor or nurse first.</p>

<p>• Ask your doctor or nurse if you can – Use tampons
– Use suppositories
– Have enemas</p>

<p>• Do not eat raw meats, raw fish, or raw eggs. Please ask your nurse or dietitian for the resource The Low Bacterial Diet if you have not already received that information.</p>

<p>• Do not share eating or drinking utensils.
• Do not get a manicure, pedicure, waxing, or tattoo without the approval of your doctor or nurse.
• Do not shave your scalp or any other part of the body. Use caution when shaving your face. If possible, use an electric razor.
• Do not touch any animal waste products (i.e., litter boxes, fish tanks, pet cages).
• Do not garden or handle soil.</p>

<p>When to Contact Your Doctor or Nurse
Call your doctor or nurse if you have any of the following signs of infection:
• A temperature of 100.4° F (38° C) or higher
• Shaking chills
• Nausea and vomiting that is not getting any better
• Flushed face
• Sweats
• Cough
• Diarrhea
• Mouth sores
• Headache

<h2>Guidelines for Patients with a low Platelet Count</h2>

<p>Platelets are colorless cells that are a part of blood. They are produced in bone marrow, the soft, spongy center in most of our large bones. The main function of platelets is to control bleeding. A normal plate- let count is 150,000-400,000 platelets per microliter (mcl) of blood.</p>

<p>If your doctor has told you that you have a low platelet count, it is very important that you take pre- cautions to prevent bleeding. You must also recognize any signs of bleeding so you can report them to your doctor or nurse. Precautions and signs of bleeding are listed below. Your platelet count may be low because of the cancer or its treatment.
Protective measures to avoid bleeding:
• Self-Care
– Avoid sharp objects such as a straightedge razor, scissors, and nail clippers.
– Use a soft toothbrush.
– Blow your nose gently, if at all.
• Perineal care
– Do not use rectal suppositories, enemas, or tampons.
– Do not take your temperature rectally.
– Consider using stool softeners or laxatives if you are straining to have bowel movements.
• Dressing
– Avoid tight clothing such as a girdle and tight undergarments or pants.
• Activities
– Wear gloves when gardening, cooking, and doing home repairs.
– Avoid any activity that may result in injury. This includes any
• Contact sports.
• Climbing ladders.
• Strenuous exercise. • Bicycling.
• Weight lifting.
• Sexual activity
– Use lubrication if needed.
– Avoid anal or oral intercourse. – Avoid strong thrusting.
• Medicines
– Do not take
• Aspirin.
• Products that have aspirin.
• Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), such as Advil®. • Vitamin E.
Ask for the card that lists common products with these medicines.
• Dental care
– Speak with your doctor before you have any routine or elective dental work.
• Do not have – Manicures. – Pedicures. – Waxing.
– Electrolysis. – Tattoos.</p>

<p>Call your doctor if you develop any symptoms of bleeding:
• Excessive bruising.
• Afaintredrashonyourtrunk,arms,andlegs.
• Vaginalspottingorheavymenstrualbleeding.
• The appearance of broken blood vessels in the “white of the eye” (sclera).</p>

<p>Steps to be taken if bleeding occurs at home:
1. Apply direct pressure on the bleeding site.
2. After applying pressure, call your MSKCC doctor. If you are unable to reach your doctor, and bleeding does not stop, go to a local emergency room.
3. Apply ice over the bridge of your nose for nosebleeds.</p>

<p>Call your doctor immediately if you have:
• Black bowel movements, blood in the stool, or rectal bleeding.
• Blood in your urine.
• Headaches that do not get better, blurred vision, dizziness.
• Any bleeding that does not get better (coughing up blood, vomiting blood, nose bleeds).

<h3>Donating Blood and Platelets</h3>

<p>Patients often need red blood cells and platelets when their counts are too low. We ask family members and friends to donate blood and are grateful when they can do it. Any blood donation helps our patients. When you start treatment, ask a family member to call the Blood Donor program to find out about giving blood. The number is (212) 639-8177. It takes about two hours to donate platelets and about 45 minutes for red blood cells. Donors can call (212) 639-7648 to make an appointment.</p>

<p>Blood donors must:
• Be 17 to 75 years of age.

<h3>Fatigue and Weakness</h3>

<p>When your red blood cell count (RBC) is low, you may feel tired. You may need extra help with your daily activities. Try to walk every day to maintain your muscle tone and strength. You may also receive red blood cell transfusions as needed. These and all other blood products will be irradiated to prevent adverse side effects.</p>

<p>Emotional Recovery
Recovery takes time. Sometimes people feel isolated and alone. You might wonder if what you are feeling is normal, and your caregivers might wonder how to reassure you. Here are some things you can do:
• Discuss your experiences with your doctor or nurse. They can provide you with guidance about what to expect during recovery from transplant as well as what you can do to help.
• Talk with your social worker for support and counseling.
• Consider joining a support group. These
are available in person or on the Internet. Cancer Care (www.cancercare.org) and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (www.lls. org) are great resources. MSKCC’s Resources for Life After Cancer program also has support groups, and they can be reached at (212) 888-4740.</p>

<p>Consider talking with someone else who
has been through transplant. The volunteer department here at MSKCC has patient volunteers. You can reach them at (212) 639- 5007. Cancer Care (www.cancercare.org) and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (www.lls.org) also offer these services.</p>

<p>Explore educational materials. The National Marrow Donor Program (www.marrow. org), The Bone Marrow Foundation (www. bonemarrow.org), Cancer Care (www. cancercare.org) and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society (www.lls.org) also offer educational materials.
• The Counseling Center at MSKCC has psychologists and psychiatrists available for consultations, therapy, and treatment of
the depression and anxiety that you may experience after your transplant. They also offer family and couples counseling. You can reach them at (646) 888-0100.
Remember, you are not alone. Your transplant team has worked with many other patients and caregivers who have experienced similar feelings. It is normal to need guidance after transplant and communication is an important part of your recovery.</p>
