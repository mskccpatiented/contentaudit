<p>Patients may need blood during operations. This blood can come from the patient or from the blood bank. When it comes from the patient, it is called an autologous blood donation. This card describes the steps you must follow before, during, and after you donate blood that will be stored for your use. For more information online, visit www.MKSCC.org and enter the search term blood donation. If you will donate your blood at a different location, please review the Local Blood Donation section at the end of this card.</p>

<p>FACTS ABOUT BLOOD DONATION:
* The blood donation process takes about one hour. This includes the interview before blood is drawn and resting time afterwards. The actual donation takes about 15 minutes.
* Blood drawn at MSKCC expires 35 days after it is collected.
* You must allow at least seven days between donations.
* No blood is collected less than one week before your surgery.<br/>
* If your operation is delayed, we may be able to freeze the blood. Frozen blood can be stored for three months, after which it is discarded. If your surgery is put on hold, ask your doctors staff if your blood can be frozen.<br/>
* It is rare but sometimes patients need more blood than the amount they donated. If this happens you will be given blood from the blood bank. If you have asked family members and friends to donate for you, their blood will be tested to make sure it is your blood type. It will also have all standard safety tests.</p>

<p>BEFORE YOU DONATE:
* Autologous blood donations require a doctor's order. Your surgeons office staff will send this order to the donor room. They will also make the appointments for you to donate.
* An appointment is required each time you donate.<br/>
* You can donate Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.<br/>
* The MSKCC Donor Room is on the first floor of the Schwartz Building. The entrance is at 1250 First Avenue, between 67th and 68th Streets.</p>

<p>DURING DONATIONS:
* Do not fast before each donation. Eat a full meal one to two hours before your appointment and drink extra fluids.
* Bring a list of all the medicines you are taking, including:
- Medicines that do and do not require a prescription.
- Herbal remedies.
- Vitamins.
- Dietary supplements.
* Call the Donor Room and speak with a nurse if:
- You feel sick on the day of a donation.
- You are taking antibiotics.
The number is 212-639-7648.</p>

<p>AFTER EACH DONATION:
* Drink extra fluids and follow your regular diet.
* Avoid tiring activities and exercise for 24 hours after each donation.
* Sometimes, the donation process can cause mild anemia. Your doctor may advise that you take an iron supplement. If so, take 325 mg of ferrous sulfate (iron supplent), by mouth three times a day. You can buy this at the drug store without a prescription. Take it with your meals to prevent stomach upset. Begin to take it as soon as possible before you donate blood. Common side effects of iron include:
- Constipation.
- Dark-color stools.
- Nausea.
* To prevent constipation, your doctor may tell you to take Colace. You should take 100 mg of it by mouth three times each day. You can buy Colace without a prescription.
* Stop both medicines two days before your surgery.
* Call your doctor and the Blood Donor Room if you have any unexpected or unexplained problems.
* The number for the Blood Donor Room is 212-639-7648.</p>

<p>LOCAL BLOOD DONATION
If you are unable to donate at our Blood Donor Room, call your local blood bank. Ask for the phone number and location of the blood bank nearest you that can ship your blood to MSKCC. Blood that has to be shipped to us must be collected two weeks before surgery.</p>

<p>Get the name of a contact person, telephone number, and fax number for your doctors office. The local blood bank can send your doctor the form to sign. The blood bank must contact MSKCCs Blood Bank before any blood is collected or shipped.<br/>
* MSKCCs Blood Bank phone number - 212-639-7826
* Fax - 646-422-2294</p>

<p>Ask at the local blood bank when the blood will be shipped. Then call them to make sure it was sent. MSKCC does not pay collection or shipping fees. Please ask your local blood bank about these fees. Call your insurance company to see if it covers fees for blood collection and shipping. If you have any questions about the information on this card, please check with:
* Your doctor.
* Your nurse.
* A staff member from the Blood Donor Room.</p>
