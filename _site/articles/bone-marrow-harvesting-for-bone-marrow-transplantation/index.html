<div class="content">
<p>Harvesting is the process of collecting stem cells. Autologous bone marrow harvesting is done to remove a patients own stem cells. The cells are given back to the patient later.  Allogeneic bone marrow harvesting is done to remove stem cells from a donor. These stem cells are given to a patient later.</p>

<p>Before your Procedure
* Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before the procedure.  This includes water.
* Tell your doctor if you:
- Have any allergies.
- Are taking any medicines.  Some may suppress bone marrow and will need to be stopped.<br/>
- Are taking aspirin, NSAIDs (ibuprofen, Motrin, Advil), and/or vitamin E. They can cause bleeding problems. Do not take medicine that has them unless your doctor says it is okay. Your nurse will give you information about what drugs you cannot take and what you can use instead.</p>

<p>Your Procedure
Harvesting is done in the operating room. You will be asleep under general anesthesia.  Bone marrow can be removed from many different sites on your body.  Some examples are the front and back of your hips and your breastbone.  The amount of marrow removed will depend on the weight and illness of the person who will receive the bone marrow.  Your weight and size may limit how much marrow you can donate. The body will replace this marrow in about 2 to 3 months. If you are donating stem cells for someone else, you may need to also give a unit of blood 2 weeks before the procedure. This blood will be given back to you in the recovery room. It will help your bone marrow recover.</p>

<p>After your Procedure:
When you wake up in the recovery room you may be sore at the harvest sites. Your nurse in the recovery room will give you pain medicine.  You will be given a prescription for pain medicine to take home with you.
* Shower after 24 hours and remove the dressings.
* Walking, general movement, and warm showers will help relieve the pain and stiffness.
* You may take aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), and vitamin E once your doctor says its ok.<br/>
* Eat a well-balanced diet high in iron (e.g., red meat, spinach) for 2 months.<br/>
* Drink 6 to 8 glasses of fluid everyday for 4 days.
* Ask your doctor about taking vitamin and iron supplements.
* Do not do strenuous exercise for 1 week. This includes running or jogging and aerobics.
* Do not swim, sit in a hot tub, or a Jacuzzi for 1 week after the procedure.
* Do not play contact sports for 1 week. This includes football, soccer, basketball and all other contact sports.</p>

<p>Call Your Doctor or Nurse If You:
* Notice bleeding from the harvest site
* Notice redness or drainage at the harvest site
* Develop chills or fever (a temperature over 100.4 F or 38 C)
* Develop a cough that does not go away
* Feel the pain is getting worse or not improving after 1 day</p>
