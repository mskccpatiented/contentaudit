<div class="metadata">
<p><strong>Primary Category: </strong>Diet, Smoking, and Lifestyles</p> 
<p><strong>Summary: </strong>A sensible eating guide. Includes information about balanced meals, dietary supplements, sample menus. What to eat after your cancer treatment.</p> 
<p><strong>Notes: </strong> This doesn't seem to be hugely relevant - BMT patients probably have a specific diet/nutrition guide.</p> 
<p><strong>Strategy/Actions: </strong>Validate relevance. Reformat large tables. Would be better as a nicely illustrated guide, or as a series of individual recipes.  (Rethink? Yes. Some re-writing? No. Graphics or diagrams? Yes. Photography? Yes. Podcast or audio? No. Video? No)</p>

<p>This information will help you maintain your nutrition during and after your cancer treatment.</p>

<p>Good nutrition is very important for patients with cancer. There may be some nutritional changes you can make now that will help you during treatment. Start by eating a healthy diet. This can increase your strength, help you maintain your weight, and help you fight infection. It may even help with the side effects of treatment.</p>

<h3>My Plate</h3>

<p>My Plate is a picture of a place setting that shows what a healthy meal should look like. It includes the 5 food groups that are the building blocks of a healthy diet. These groups include whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products. Foods that are high in fat and sugar should be limited or avoided. For more information about the My Plate guidelines, visit www.myplate.gov.</p>

<p>The side effects of cancer and treatment can make it hard to eat. When this happens, it may be difficult for you to follow the My Plate guidelines. You may need to change your eating plan if you cant eat certain foods.</p>

<h3>How Treatment Can Affect Eating</h3>

<h4>Surgery</h4>

<p>If your weight is below normal, you may have to gain weight before your surgery. In this booklet, you will find suggestions for how to eat more calories and protein. This can help you put on weight before surgery and help you heal afterward.</p>

<p>Having mouth, throat, or stomach surgery can make it hard to eat. Sometimes, nutrition must be given to patients in other ways. It can be given through a vein, a tube in the nose, or straight into the stomach or the upper part of the intestine.</p>

<h4>Radiation</h4>

<p>Radiation treatment to the head and neck can cause trouble swallowing, taste changes, dry mouth, or soreness in the mouth or throat. Treatment to the chest can cause trouble swallowing. Treatment to the stomach, abdominal (stomach) area, or pelvis can cause nausea and vomiting. It can also cause diarrhea, cramps, and bloating.</p>

<h4>Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>Many chemotherapy drugs can affect your digestive system. They can cause nausea and vomiting, decreased appetite, diarrhea, constipation, weight gain or loss, and changes in the taste or smell of food.</p>

<h4>Immunotherapy</h4>

<p>Immunotherapy stimulates your bodys immune system to fight cancer cells. Side effects include</p>

<ul>
<li>Nausea and vomiting  Diarrhea</li>
<li>Sore mouth</li>
<li>Dry mouth</li>
<li>Weight loss</li>
<li>Changes in the taste of food  Muscle aches</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Fever</li>
</ul>


<h4>Hormonal therapy</h4>

<p>Hormonal therapy uses medications that stop your body from making some hormones or change the way they work. Side effects include changes in appetite, water retention, weight gain, and nausea and vomiting.</p>

<h3>General Nutritional Guidelines</h3>

<h4>Vitamin and mineral supplements</h4>

<p>You can get 100% of your daily recommended nutrients from a well-balanced diet. If your diet is lacking, vitamins and mineral supplements can help. Some patients take large amounts of antioxidants, herbs, or extra vitamins and minerals because they think it will help cure their cancer. This has not been shown to help in the fight against cancer. During some kinds of cancer treatments, this can actually harm you. If you are thinking about doing this, speak with your doctor first. A dietitian or pharmacist can also answer any questions you have.</p>

<h4>Alternative and complementary therapies</h4>

<p>You may have read or heard about alternative therapies. Sometimes, these are used in place of conventional treatment. The safety and effectiveness of many of these treatments have not been confirmed. We do know that some are not safe. Others can interfere with your chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Speak to your doctor or nurse before you start any of these treatments. It could make your treatment less effective and cause harm.</p>

<p>Complementary therapies can help patients cope with some of the symptoms of cancer and side effects of treatment, such as nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. They can also help reduce stress and promote a feeling of well-being. They do not cause any harm. Complementary therapies include</p>

<ul>
<li>Reflexology</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Massage</li>
<li>Music therapy</li>
<li>Yoga</li>
<li>Tai Chi</li>
<li>Acupuncture</li>
</ul>


<h3>Food safety</h3>

<p>During cancer treatment, your body has a hard time fighting off infection. It is more important than ever to make sure that the foods you are eating are safe. This will reduce your risk for foodborne illnesses and other infections. Below are a few suggestions to prevent any problems.</p>

<p>Before and after preparing food, wash your hands well with soap and warm water. Clean your cutting boards and counters thoroughly.</p>

<p>Avoid eating any foods that have raw or undercooked eggs, meat, poultry, fish, or shellfish. Make sure that these raw foods or their juices never come in contact with other foods.</p>

<p>Eat only pasteurized milk and cheeses. Drink only processed or pasteurized juices and ciders.</p>

<p>Wash all raw fruits and vegetables well before eating, even if you are going to peel the skin off.</p>

<p>Thaw frozen foods in the refrigerator. Do not leave them out to thaw at room temperature.</p>

<p>After cooking, cool foods in the refrigerator. Do not let them cool at room temperature.</p>

<p>If your immune system gets weaker, your doctor may ask you to follow stricter guidelines than those above. You may need to cut out most raw or uncooked fruits and vegetables, cold cuts and processed meats, raw honey, and unpasteurized products.</p>

<h3>Calories and Protein</h3>

<p>The suggestions in this booklet may be different from those in the My Plate guidelines. You may be told to add more of a certain food to increase your intake of calories and protein or decrease your discomfort with eating. A dietitian can help you find an eating plan that works best for you.</p>

<p>Tips for getting the most from your meals</p>

<p>Large meals can seem overwhelming or unappealing. This can happen when you have a decreased appetite or feel full shortly after you start eating. The following suggestions can help you get enough calories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eat small meals 6 to 8 times a day instead of 3 main meals.</li>
<li>Serve smaller food portions on salad plates instead of dinner plates.</li>
<li>Drink hot chocolate, fruit juices, and nectars that are high in calories.</li>
<li>Avoid low-calorie drinks, such as water, coffee, tea, and diet drinks. Make Double Milk and milkshakes using the recipes in this booklet.</li>
<li>Have your favorite snack foods available at home and at work.</li>
<li>Eat your favorite foods at any time of the day. For example, eat breakfast foods such as pancakes or omelets for lunch or dinner.</li>
<li>Include different colors and textures of foods in your meals to make them more appealing.</li>
<li>Make dining a good experience by eating your meals in a pleasant, relaxing setting with family or friends.</li>
<li>Smells such as bread baking or bacon frying may help boost your appetite.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tips for adding more protein to your diet</h3>

<p>Your body needs a balance of calories and protein to function at its best. You may temporarily need more protein in your diet. If so, your doctor or dietitian will let you know. If you recently had surgery or have wounds, eating more protein will help you heal. The following are suggestions to help you increase the protein in your diet:</p>

<p>Eat foods rich in protein, such as chicken, fish, pork, beef, lamb, eggs, milk, cheese, beans, and tofu.</p>

<p>Drink Double Milk and use it in recipes that call for milk or water. You can use it in instant pudding, cocoa, omelets, and pancake mixes.</p>

<p>Add cheese and diced meats to your omelets.</p>

<p>Add powdered milk to creamy soups, mashed potatoes, milkshakes, and casseroles.</p>

<p>Snack on cheese or nut butters (e.g., peanut butter, cashew butter, and almond butter) with crackers.</p>

<p>Spread nut butters on apples, bananas, or celery.</p>

<p>Try apple slices with cheese wedges and honey drizzled on top. Blend peanut butter into your chocolate or vanilla shakes. Snack on roasted nuts and sunflower, pumpkin, or chia seeds.</p>

<p>Try hummus (a tasty Middle Eastern chickpea dip) with pita bread.</p>

<p>Add cooked meats to soups, casseroles, salads, and omelets.</p>

<p>Add wheat germ or ground flax seeds to cereals, casseroles, yogurt, and meat spreads.</p>

<p>Eat desserts that are made with eggs. These include angel food cake, puddings, custards, and cheesecakes.</p>

<p>Add grated cheese to sauces, vegetables, and soups. You can also add it to baked or mashed potatoes, casseroles, and salads.</p>

<p>Melt cheese on hamburgers and breaded cutlets.</p>

<p>Add chickpeas, kidney beans, tofu, hard-boiled eggs, nuts, and cooked meats or fish to your salads.</p>

<h3>Tips for adding more calories to your diet</h3>

<p>The suggestions below can help you take in more calories. They may seem to go against what you read and hear about healthy eating. However, while you are healing, it is more important that you get enough calories than eat only healthy foods.</p>

<p>Dont eat foods that are fat-free or reduced in fat. Avoid food and drink labels that say low-fat, non-fat, or diet. For example, use whole milk instead of skim.</p>

<p>Snack on dried fruits, nuts, or dried seeds. Add them to hot cereals, ice cream, or salads.</p>

<p>Drink fruit nectars or fruit shakes.</p>

<p>Add butter, margarine, or oils to potatoes, rice, and pasta. Also add them to cooked vegetables, sandwiches, toast, and hot cereals.</p>

<p>Add cream cheese to toast or bagels or use it as a spread on vegetables.</p>

<p>Spread cream cheese and jam or peanut butter and jelly on crackers.</p>

<p>Add jelly or honey to breads and crackers.</p>

<p>Mix jam with diced fruit and use it as a topping over ice cream or cake.</p>

<p>Snack on tortilla chips with guacamole. Add avocado slices to your salads.</p>

<p>Use high-calorie dressings on salads, baked potatoes, and on chilled cooked vegetables, such as green beans or asparagus.</p>

<p>Add sour cream, half and half, or heavy cream to mashed potatoes and cake and cookie recipes. You can also add it to pancake batter, sauces, gravies, soups, and casseroles.</p>

<p>Top cakes, waffles, French toast, fruits, puddings, and hot chocolate with whipped cream.</p>

<p>Make vegetables or pasta with cream sauces.</p>

<p>Use mayonnaise in salads, sandwiches, and vegetable dips.</p>

<p>Mix granola with yogurt or put it on top of ice cream or fruits.</p>

<p>Top your ice cream or unfrosted cakes with sweetened condensed milk. Combine the condensed milk with peanut butter to add more calories and flavor.</p>

<p>Add croutons to your salads or omelets.</p>

<p>Include bread stuffing as a side dish with your meals.</p>

<p>Drink homemade shakes. You can also drink high-calorie, high-protein drinks, such as Carnation Instant Breakfast or Ensure. See the next section for a list of nutritional supplements you can buy. Or, try the shake recipes on page 23 of this booklet.</p>

<h3>Sample Menus</h3>

<p>Use these 4 sample menus to spark your imagination. They can give you ideas for making your own, high-calorie, high-protein meals
at home. You may find it easier to divide a meal into 2 portions so that you have a small, ready-made meal to eat later in the day. If it is hard for you to make your meals, ask family or friends for help. Try making meals in batches on days when you have the energy and freeze them for a later date. You can also eat ready-made foods, if necessary.</p>

<h4>Key points</h4>

<p>If you have diabetes or high blood sugar, use products that are unsweetened or are made with sugar substitutes. Limit the amount of fruit juice that you drink.</p>

<p>The amount of liquid in the meal plans is small so you dont feel full early during meals. Try to drink most of your liquids in between your meals. An average-sized adult needs 8 to 10, 8-ounce cups of liquids per day. This includes juices, water, milkshakes, and soups. It also includes solids that become liquid at room temperature such as Italian ices.</p>

<p>If you are lactose-intolerant, you should not drink regular cows milk. Instead, you should drink Lactaid milk, rice milk, almond milk, or soy milk.* Try the sweetened versions of these milks for extra calories. Take Lactaid tablets or drops with other dairy foods, such as ice cream or soft cheeses. Patients with mild to moderate lactose intolerance can usually handle hard aged cheeses and yogurt.</p>

<p>Vegetarian and vegan menus are included. Both vegetarians and vegans should eat more nuts, seeds, and oils to increase their calories. Vegans should consider including dairy products and eggs in their diet. They should also take special care to eat foods rich in vitamin B12, calcium, iron, and zinc. Speak with a dietitian if you follow a vegetarian or vegan diet.</p>

<p>Fruits and vegetables are low in calories. Therefore, they are not included in the meal plans often. You may find that you are not meeting the daily recommended servings. You may need to take a multivitamin, but check with your doctor first.</p>

<p>See page 23 for recipes for Double Milk and the shakes listed in the sample menus.
*If you have or have had breast cancer, ask your doctor if it is okay for you to eat foods with soy.</p>

Managing Symptoms and Side Effects Through Nutrition
This section describes some tips you can use to help you with  Constipation
 Diarrhea
 Dry or sore mouth  Taste changes
 Nausea
Please report any symptoms to your doctor and nurse before following these tips.
Constipation
Constipation is a decrease in your bowel movements. It can include  Trouble passing stools (feces)
 Hard stools
 Not being able to empty your bowel
Constipation can be caused by many things, including diet, activity, and lifestyle. Some chemotherapy and pain medications can also cause constipation. Dietary causes include irregular meals, not eating enough fiber, and not drinking enough liquids. Fiber is important because it increases the bulk in your digestive tract. This helps move waste out of your body. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains have fiber. Below are ways to manage constipation through your diet.
26 Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</p>

<p>Eat more high-fiber foods
Add fiber to your diet one food at a time. Be sure to drink enough liquids to prevent gas and bloating. Examples of high-fiber foods are
 Fruits
 Vegetables
 Whole grains (e.g., whole-grain cereals, pastas, muffins, breads, and brown rice)
 Nuts and seeds
Drink plenty of liquids
Try to drink at least 8 to 10, 8-ounce glasses of liquid per day. Drink water, fruit and vegetable juices, milk, and other liquids. This will help keep your stool soft.
Eat at consistent times
Try to eat your meals at the same time each day. If you make changes to your diet, do it slowly.
Diarrhea
Diarrhea is frequent, loose, watery bowel movements. It causes food
to pass quickly through your intestines. When this happens, water and nutrients are not absorbed well by your body. Diarrhea can be caused by
 Chemotherapy
 Radiation therapy
 Surgery of the stomach or intestines
 Medications
 Difficulty digesting milk and milk products  Other food sensitivities
Check with your doctor before you use the suggestions below to manage your diarrhea.
Eating Well During and After Your Cancer Treatment 27</p>

<p>Drink plenty of liquids
Drink at least 8 to 10, 8-ounce glasses of liquids daily. This will help replace the water and nutrients you lose when you have diarrhea. Try drinking
 Water
 Fruit juices and nectars mixed with water
 Sports drinks like Gatorade
 Clear broth
 Caffeine-free soda. Let the soda sit out uncovered for a few minutes before drinking to reduce the fizz
Avoid very hot or cold, high-sugar, high-fat, and spicy foods. These are hard on your digestive system and may make your diarrhea worse.
Follow the dietary guidelines below if you are having diarrhea.
Fruits and Vegetables
Foods to try
 Well-cooked, peeled and pureed, or canned fruits and vegetables
 Bananas
 Peeled apples
 Juices or nectars mixed
with water
 Smooth peanut butter
Most of these items have potassium and liquid to help replace what your body loses from diarrhea. They also have soluble fiber, which may decrease diarrhea.
Foods to avoid
 Raw fruits and vegetables, nuts, and seeds (except those allowed)
 Vegetables that can cause gas such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, beans, and onions
28 Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</p>

<p>Starches and Carbohydrates
Foods to try
 Refined white breads, cereals, rice, pasta, and farina
 Boiled or mashed potatoes (without the skins)
 Crackers, pretzels, and graham crackers
Some of these foods contain salt to help replace what your body loses from diarrhea.
Foods to avoid
 Whole-grain breads, pastas, cereals, and brown rice
 Bread products with nuts or seeds
 Fatty breads and pastries, such as croissants and doughnuts
 Fried potatoes
Meat and Meat Alternatives
Foods to try
 Lean meats, such as chicken or turkey breast without skin
 Hard-boiled eggs
 Tofu
These are bland, low-fat, and low-fiber foods. They are easier on your digestive system.
Foods to avoid

Cut your foods into small pieces that are easy for you to chew. Rinse your mouth out with water often.
Drink liquids with your meals, sipping in between bites.
Use a straw to drink liquid to prevent it from touching your sore mouth.</p>

<p> If you have dry mouth, try sugar-free mints or gum to make more saliva.
 Brush your teeth (with the permission of your doctor or dentist) and tongue. Drink more liquids to help to keep your mouth clean.
Taste Changes
Your sense of taste is made up of 4 main sensations. These are saltiness, sweetness, bitterness, and sourness. Your sense of taste can be affected by chemotherapy, radiation, and other medications. Changes in taste vary from patient to patient. The most common changes are having bitter and metallic tastes in your mouth. Sometimes, food may not taste like anything.
When your food seems tasteless
 Change the texture of your foods. For example, you may prefer mashed potatoes to baked potatoes or vice versa. Some foods may taste better cold or at room temperature.
 Choose and prepare foods that look and smell good to you.
 Use more spices and flavorings as tolerated, for example
 Add sauces and condiments, such as soy sauce or ketchup, to your food
 Marinate your meats or meat substitutes in salad dressings, fruit juices, or other sauces
 Use onion or garlic to flavor your vegetables or meats
 Add herbs, such as rosemary, basil, oregano, and mint to your food
 Blend fruit into your milkshakes or yogurt. Try mint or coffee-flavored milkshakes
 Try sour and tart foods. These may help stimulate your taste.

<p>If there is a bitter or metallic taste in your mouth
 Rinse your mouth out with water before meals.
 Maintain good oral hygiene by brushing your teeth (if your doctor allows it) and your tongue and drinking more liquids.
 If meats taste bitter, try marinating them in sauces or fruit juices.
 Include meat substitutes for protein, such as dairy products and beans.
 Use plastic utensils to reduce the metallic taste.
 Try sugar-free mints or gum.
If foods taste or smell different than usual

Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</p>

<p>Avoid foods with strong odors. Since beef and fish have the strongest odors, try eating poultry, eggs, and dairy products.
Experiment with different seasonings and food combinations, such as
 Adding sauces to foods
 Changing the temperature and texture of foods
Try adding lemon juice or salt if the food tastes too sweet.
If your mouth is not sore, try tart foods such as lemon wedges or citrus fruits to stimulate taste.
Rinse your mouth out before and after you eat.
Drink small sips of liquid throughout your meals to rinse out the taste of the food.
Maintain good oral hygiene by brushing your teeth (if your doctor allows it) and tongue and drinking more liquids. Your doctor may also recommend using a mouthwash. This may help you manage your taste changes.</p>

<p>Check with your doctor or dentist to find out the cause of your taste changes. You should do this before you make any long-term changes to your diet. If you have any questions or concerns about your dietary needs, contact a dietitian.
Nausea
Nausea is a feeling of stomach upset or queasiness. If you have nausea, you may also have vomiting. Nausea can be caused by radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. It can also be caused by pain, medication, and infection. Below are suggestions for managing your nausea through nutrition. Check with your doctor or nurse before you try any of the tips below. Also, ask if you need an antiemetic. This is a medication to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting.

<p>General tips
 Pay attention to the amount of food you eat.
 Try convenience foods to prevent nausea while you cook or prepare foods. If you need to, ask others to cook for you.
 Eat small, frequent meals. This can stop you from getting too full and allow you to take in more food throughout the day.
 Drink most liquids in between your meals to prevent feeling full too fast, bloating, or both.
 Eat slowly and chew your foods well to help with digestion. Avoid activity right after meals.
 Eat your meals in a pleasant setting. Choose a relaxing place that has a comfortable temperature. Avoid places with strong odors. Eating with friends or family may also help distract you from your nausea. Wear loose-fitting clothing to stay comfortable.
 If you experience nausea in the morning, keep crackers or dry toast at your bedside. Eat these before getting out of bed.
 Avoid eating your favorite foods right before or after treatments. You may begin to dislike these foods.
If nausea is an ongoing problem for you, it may be useful to keep
a food diary. This is a record of the foods you eat, the time you ate them, and the setting in which you ate them. Record any situations when you became nauseous. Discuss this with your doctor, nurse, or dietitian.
Fatigue
Fatigue is the most common side effect of cancer and cancer treatments. It may prevent you from doing your daily activities. It may also impact your quality of life and decrease your tolerance to treatment. There are many ways to decrease your fatigue.
36 Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</p>

<p>Fatigue can be caused by many symptoms, such as  Poor appetite
 Depression
 Nausea and vomiting
 Diarrhea or constipation
Relief of these symptoms can give you more energy. It can also increase your feeling of well-being. There are many useful tips to improve these symptoms throughout this booklet.
Another option is to save your energy. You can do this by asking family and friends for help with shopping and preparing your meals. Buy already prepared or takeout foods when your energy is low. Keep ingredients and utensils that you use often close at hand. Try sitting instead of standing when cooking. If you eat small, frequent, high- calorie meals or snacks, your body may not need as much energy to digest your food. This can help you maintain your energy throughout the day.
If you live alone and are not able to shop for food or prepare meals, you may be eligible for food programs, such as Gods Love We Deliver or Meals on Wheels. There may be age or income requirements for some programs. Your social worker can give you more information.
Medication
While diet changes can help, medication may be needed to manage your side effects. Medication can help with nausea, diarrhea, and constipation. Tell your doctor or nurse about any side effects you have during your treatment.

<p>After Your Cancer Treatment Ends
When your cancer treatment is over, it is a good time to think about making good food choices. You will want to make choices that promote health and well-being. Select foods low in fat and rich in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and phytochemicals. Phytochemicals, also known as phytonutrients, are plant substances that may protect against cancer. Examples of phytochemicals include lycopene in tomatoes, curcumin in tumeric, and resveratrol in grape skins.
Diet is linked to health. There is no evidence that the foods you eat will prevent your cancer from coming back. But, eating the right foods will help you regain your strength, rebuild tissue, and feel your best. The following tips may help:
 Include many kinds of fruits and vegetables in your diet to make sure you get many different nutrients. You can eat fruits and vegetables cooked or raw at any time of the day. Be sure
to eat more of the non-starchy vegetables. These include artichokes, artichoke hearts, asparagus, beans (green wax, Italian) bean sprouts, beets, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, eggplant, green onions (scallions), kohlrabi, leeks, mushrooms, okra, onions, peppers, radishes, salad greens (endive, escarole, iceberg lettuce, romaine, green and red leaf lettuce, spinach), summer squash, tomatoes, turnips, water chestnuts, watercress, and zucchini. Starchy vegetables, such as corn, greens peas, plantains, potatoes, winter squash (acorn butternut, pumpkin), and yams are also good to eat and should be served with the foods listed above.
 Eat whole-grain breads and cereals. Select high-fiber foods, such as bran and shredded wheat cereals, brown rice, and multigrain, whole wheat, and oat breads. Try different grains, such as barley, buckwheat, and bulgur. Legumes are also an excellent source of fiber and nutrients. They include beans and peas (garbanzo, pinto, kidney, white, split, black-eyed, and lima), lentils, and miso (thick soy paste).

<p> Limit fat, salt, sugar, alcohol, and smoked, cured, or pickled foods.
 Choose low-fat milk products, lean meats, poultry without skin, and baked fish.
 Prepare meals using lower-fat cooking methods such as broiling, steaming, and poaching.
Mealtime is an important part of the day for many patients. Illness can impact eating and decrease the enjoyment we feel during this time. We hope the suggestions in this booklet will help you continue to look forward to this time and eat well.
Remember to focus on eating a variety of foods each day. No one food contains all the nutrients you need.
If you have any questions about these guidelines, talk to a dietitian. If you have any special concerns, speak with your doctor or dietitian.
