<p><strong>Summary: </strong>What herbal remedies can do, what side-effects they can cause.</p> 


</div>
<p>One week before you have surgery or start chemotherapy, you must stop taking any herbal or botanical home remedies.</p>

<p>Some of these can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Interact with other drugs.</li>
<li>Increase or lower blood pressure.</li>
<li>Thin the blood and raise the risk of bleeding.</li>
<li>Make radiation therapy less effective.</li>
<li>Lower the effects of medicines that suppress the immune system.</li>
<li>Increase the effects of medicine that numbs the body or makes you fall asleep for surgery</li>
</ul>


<p>Below are examples of some common herbs and a description of their effects.</p>

<h3>Acai Berry</h3>

<p>Due to the way it interacts with chemicals in the body (its antioxidant effects), acai may get in the way of the actions of certain chemotherapy drugs.</p>

<h3>Echinacea</h3>

<ul>
<li>May cause an allergic reaction such as a rash or difficulty breathing.</li>
<li>Lowers the effect of drugs used to hold back the immune system.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Garlic</h3>

<ul>
<li>Lowers blood pressure and fat and cholesterol levels.</li>
<li>Prevents platelets (the blood cells that help stop bleeding) from sticking together. This increases the risk of bleeding.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Ginkgo (Also known as Ginkgo biloba)</h3>

<p>May change how platelets work. This can increase the risk of bleeding.</p>

<h3>Ginseng</h3>

<ul>
<li>May act as  to increase nervous activity in the body. It could decrease the effects of medicine that numbs the body or makes you fall asleep for surgery</li>
<li>May get in the way with how platelets work. This can increase the risk of bleeding.</li>
<li>Lowers blood glucose (sugar) level.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Turmeric</h3>

<ul>
<li>May reduce the anti-tumor action of some chemotherapy drugs.</li>
</ul>


<h3>St. John's Wort</h3>

<ul>
<li>Could interact with medicines that you may be given during surgery.</li>
<li>May make the skin more sensitive to laser treatment.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Valerian</h3>

<p>May have a sedative-hypnotic effect that could increase the effects of medicine that numbs the body or makes you fall asleep for surgery.*</p>

<h3>Herbal Formulas</h3>

<p>Many herbal preparations have different herbs. We do not know their side effects. You must also stop taking these products one week before and during treatment.</p>

<p>For more information, look at our web site <em>About Herbs, Botanicals &amp; Other Products</em> (http://www.mskcc.org/aboutherbs).</p>

<p>The information on this card is selective and does not cover all possible side effects; others may occur. Please share any questions or concerns with your doctor or nurse.</p>
