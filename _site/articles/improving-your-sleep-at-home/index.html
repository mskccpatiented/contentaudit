<p>Sleeping well at night can make you feel better and give you more energy. Some patients with cancer experience problems with their sleep, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Feeling sleepy during the day</li>
<li>Having trouble falling asleep</li>
<li>Waking up in the middle of the night</li>
</ul>


<p>If you are having these problems, try the following suggestions.</p>

<h3>During the Day</h3>

<p>Exercise
Do some form of exercise each day, but not within 2 to 3 hours before bedtime</p>

<p>Get some sunlight</p>

<p>Make an effort to get some sunlight each day, especially in the morning. Open your shades or go outside</p>

<p>Limit your napping</p>

<p>Taking naps in the late afternoon can make it harder for you to fall asleep at night</p>

<p>If you feel you must take a nap, take it earlier in the day and set an alarm to wake you up after 30 minutes</p>

<p>Keep track of your sleep</p>

<p>Keep a record of the times you go to sleep (including naps) and wake up (including during the night). This can help you notice any patterns on the nights you have problems with your sleep
Ask about treatments</p>

<p>Ask your doctor or nurse about treatments available to improve your sleep, including behavioral therapy. This can be effective without the use of medication</p>

<p>Meet with a sleep specialist at the MSKCC Counseling Center. You can contact the center at (646) 888-0200</p>

<p>The MSKCC Integrative Medicine Service offers relaxation therapies that might help you sleep better. You can contact the service at (646) 888-0800</p>

<h3>At Bedtime</h3>

<p>Dim the lights</p>

<p>Light tells your brain to stay awake, so dimming it will help your body get ready to sleep. Turn off any bright lights and use low-watt light bulbs (including in the bathroom) in the evening</p>

<p>Limit your time in front of the computer, TV, or video game. Dim the screen if possible</p>

<p>Limit food and drinks</p>

<p>Avoid caffeine and nicotine several hours before bedtime. They can both keep you awake</p>

<p>Limit your intake of alcohol. It may help you fall asleep, but it will make you wake up in the middle of the night</p>

<p>Finish eating dinner 3 hours before you want to go to sleep</p>

<p>Limit fluids before bedtime, especially if you often get up at night to urinate Make your bedroom comfortable
 Keep the bedroom quiet, dark, and cool. If you cannot make your bedroom dark, use a sleep mask</p>

<p>If noise is a problem, try earplugs or white noise such as a CD with ocean sounds</p>

<p>Switch to a heavier or lighter blanket as the seasons change</p>

<p>Don't watch TV, use the computer, or talk on the phone while lying on your bed. Use your bed only for sleep and sexual intercourse</p>

<p>Don't let pets sleep in your bedroom because their movements may wake you up Take time to relax each evening before going to sleep. Try any of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deep breathing exercises</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Massage</li>
<li>Listening to music</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>A warm bath</li>
</ul>


<h4>Ease your mind</h4>

<p>If you cant get your mind off of your worries, make a list of things you are worried about. Then, write down what you can do to decrease that worry. For example, you might ask the doctor about a symptom or talk about your fears with a friend or family member. Tell yourself that you will do those things the next day</p>

<p>Turn your clocks around. Staring at the clock can keep you awake and worried</p>

<p>Don't lie in bed awake. Feeling anxious about not being able to sleep can make it harder to fall asleep. If you are still awake after 20 minutes, get up and do a relaxing activity until you feel sleepy.</p>

<p>If you have to get up in the middle of the night, be safe</p>

<p>Make sure the floor is clear of objects, including clothes and area rugs</p>

<p>Use night-lights in the bathroom and hall</p>

<p>Keep a glass of water, a phone, and a lamp by your bed in case you need them</p>

<p>Stick with a routine</p>

<p>Go to bed at the same time each evening and get up at the same time in the morning, even on the weekends</p>

<h3>Deep Breathing Exercise</h3>

<p>Deep breathing is an exercise that can help you relax. It is very simple and you can teach it to yourself. It can help you clear your mind, release tension, and sleep better. You can do it any time you feel stressed or anxious.</p>

<ol>
<li>Get into a comfortable position in a chair or in your bed. Raise your head as much as possible.</li>
<li>Place one hand on your stomach, just below your ribs. If you are right handed, use your right hand; if you are left handed, use your left hand.</li>
<li>Exhale completely through your mouth.</li>
<li>If you can, close your eyes and inhale slowly and deeply through your nose. Feel your stomach push up on your hand. Imagine that air is filling your whole body from the bottom up.</li>
<li>Pause for a couple of seconds. Then, exhale slowly through your mouth or nose. Try to exhale completely and imagine the air leaving your lungs, mouth, or nose.</li>
<li>As you exhale, allow your body to relax and go limplike a rag doll.</li>
<li>Repeat the exercise 5 to 10 times.</li>
</ol>
