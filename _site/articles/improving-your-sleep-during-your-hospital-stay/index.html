<h3>Deep Breathing Exercise</h3>

<p>Deep breathing is an exercise that can help you relax. It is very simple, and you can teach it to yourself. It can help you clear your mind, release tension, and sleep better. You can do it any time you feel stressed or anxious.</p>

<ol>
<li>Get into a comfortable position in a chair or in your bed. Raise your head as much as possible.</li>
<li>Place one hand on your stomach, just below your ribs. If you are right handed, use your right hand; if you are left handed, use your left hand.</li>
<li>Exhale completely through your mouth.</li>
<li>If you can, close your eyes and inhale slowly and deeply through your nose.
Feel your stomach push up on your hand. Imagine that air is filling your whole body from the bottom up.</li>
<li>Pause for a couple of seconds. Then, exhale slowly through your mouth or nose. Try
to exhale completely and imagine the air leaving your lungs, mouth, or nose.</li>
<li>As you exhale, allow your body to relax and go limp like a rag doll.</li>
<li>Repeat the exercise 5 to 10 times.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Ease your mind</h3>

<p>If you cant get your mind off of your worries, make a list of things you are worried about. Then, write down what you can do to decrease that worry. For example, you might ask the doctor about a symptom or talk about your fears with a friend or family member. Tell yourself that you will do those things the next day</p>

<p>If you cannot fall asleep, get up and take a short walk. You can also try a light activity, such as reading a book or doing a crossword puzzle for 30 minutes. Then, do a relaxation activity
