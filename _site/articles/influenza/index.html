<p>Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is caused by a virus that attacks the respiratory system. Anyone can get the flu. It is most serious in the elderly, in people with chronic underlying illness, and in those with weakened immune systems. There are two main types of virus, type A and B. More serious illness tends to be associated with type A. Each type includes many strains that tend to change from year to year.</p>

<p>Symptoms
Flu symptoms include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fever.</li>
<li>Chills.</li>
<li>Headache.</li>
<li>Extreme tiredness.</li>
<li>Body aches.</li>
<li>Cough.</li>
<li>Sore throat.</li>
</ul>


<p>Children can have nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  These symptoms are rare in adults.</p>

<h3>How is it spread</h3>

<p>Flu is very contagious. It is spread through contact with droplets from the nose and throat of someone who is infected. The droplets fly into the air when the person coughs or sneezes. The flu can be spread one day before someone has symptoms. This means you can give someone the flu before you know you are sick.</p>

<h3>Cold vs Flu</h3>

<p>The common cold and the flu are caused by different viruses. Because they share many symptoms it can be difficult to tell the difference between them. Lab tests, if done within the first two or three days of illness, can help in making a diagnosis. In general, cold symptoms are milder and do not lead to serious health problems. The flu may cause severe illness and life-threatening complications.</p>

<h3>Precautions for Inpatients</h3>

<ul>
<li>If the flu is suspected or diagnosed, you will be placed in a private room.</li>
<li>A sign will be posted on the door telling all staff and visitors to take precautions.</li>
<li>All staff and visitors must clean their hands before going into and after leaving your room. They can use soap and water or alcohol hand cleanser.</li>
<li>All staff and visitors who enter your room must wear a mask, yellow gown, and gloves.</li>
<li>If you leave your room for any reason, you must wear a mask, yellow gown, and gloves.</li>
<li>You may not visit any public places in the hospital. If you want to have art or massage therapy, you may have it in your room. Please do not go to the:
<strong> Recreation Center on M15.
</strong> Playroom on M9.
<strong> Cafeteria.
</strong> Main lobby.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you no longer have any symptoms and a lab test is negative, precautions will be discontinued. You may then be moved back to a double room.</p>

<h3>Precautions for Outpatients</h3>

<ul>
<li>Please let the receptionist know when you check in for an appointment if you think you might have the flu. A nurse can bring you to a private office.  The nurse will ask about your symptoms and decide how you should be treated.</li>
<li>Do not sit in waiting areas where you can spread any germs to others.</li>
<li>Do not eat in the cafeteria or visit other public spaces such as the library.</li>
<li>Do not visit inpatients.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Prevention</h3>

<p>The best way to prevent flu is to get the flu vaccine every year. If you have low immunity ask family members and close friends to get the flu shot.</p>

<p>To prevent the spread of influenza:</p>

<ul>
<li>Always cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow, not your hand.</li>
<li>Wash your hands frequently or use alcohol hand cleanser, especially after you cough or sneeze.</li>
<li>Stay away from sick people as much as possible.</li>
<li>Do not go to work, school, or visit the hospital if you have flu-like symptoms.</li>
<li>Antiviral medicines can help prevent or reduce the severity of the flu. They do not take the place of an annual flu shot.</li>
</ul>
