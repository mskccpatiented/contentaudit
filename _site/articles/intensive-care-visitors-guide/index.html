<p>This information describes what to expect while your loved one is in the ICU. This can be an overwhelming and stressful time, and it can be hard to understand whats going on. The ICU team is here to help you. Please review the information in this booklet, including the resources listed at the end. If you have any questions or if theres anything we can do to support you, please let us know.
About the ICU
The ICU is on the 11th floor of the main Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center building. You can reach members of the ICU team by calling (212) 639-7555.
Admissions Procedure
When your loved one is brought to the ICU, please wait in the visitors lounge. The admission process can take an hour or longer depending on the patients condition. We ask you to please be patient; we are doing all that we can to attend to your loved ones needs. As soon as he or she is able to have visitors, a member of the ICU team will come to the lounge to get you.
What You Should Expect
When you enter the ICU, you will notice that most of the patients are surrounded by equipment and tubing. This equipment is specific to each individual patients needs. Each piece of equipment has an alarm that alerts the nurse to changes or movements. The nurses are skilled in understanding these alarms and respond appropriately.

About the ICU Team
The ICU team includes many people highly experienced in critical care.
 The attending is the doctor in charge. He or she is trained in critical care medicine.
 Fellows are doctors who have completed training in a specialty as a doctor. Now they are getting extra training in ICU medicine.
 First year residents are doctors who are completing their training.
 Interns are doctors who are in their first year of training after medical school.
 Nurse practitioners (NPs) are advanced practice nurses with additional graduate school training and licensing.
 Clinical nurses are registered nurses who specialize in critical care nursing. The ICU nurses give patients the day to day bedside care they need. These nurses have had extra training and experience in the care of ICU patients. Nursing care is based on the primary nursing model, which means that the same nurse will care for your loved one as much as possible. Our ICU nurses work 3 three shifts: 8:00 am  8:30 pm, noon  12:30 am, and 8:00 pm  8:30 am.
 Social workers help families deal with the social issues that come up when a person is very ill.
 Respiratory therapists are specially trained to care for patients with breathing problems.
 Dietitians make sure that the patients get the right kind of food while they are in the ICU.
 Physical therapists help patients get their physical strength back during and after the illness.
2
 Patient care technicians assist the bedside nurse with patients care.
 Clinical nurse specialists are advanced-practice nurses. They help patients and families understand complex treatments and assist staff nurses when needed.
 The nurse leader is responsible for the unit 24 hours a day and oversees the delivery of all patient care within the unit. He
or she works closely with the ICU team, patients, and family members. Family members or patients can schedule time with the nurse leader if they have concerns or questions.
The critical care team rounds each morning to discuss the patients plan of care for the day. The ICU doctors work with the patients primary doctor, and other specialists are called if they are needed. The ICU team can give you a daily progress report during the patients stay in the ICU. Other resources that you may find helpful are listed on the last page of this leaflet.
Please Visit
Enjoy your visit with your loved one between the hours of 11:00 am and 7:00 pm. Its important for patients to have visits from friends and family. Because visits can be tiring for patients, shorter visits are best. We ask the following of you, the friends and family:
 Consult with the nurse to establish a visiting schedule that will not tire your loved one.
 Be courteous to other visitors.
 Limit the time you spend in the waiting room. No more than 4 people in one family group should wait in our waiting area. There is extra space in the main waiting area on the first floor.
 Understand that if the nurse asks you to leave, it is in your loved ones best interest.
3
 Do not visit on Wednesdays between 3:00 pm and 4:00 pm. During this time, a team of specialists meet to review the plan of care for each patient.
 Donate blood if possible, and ask friends and family members to do the same. Call the Blood Donor Room at (212) 639-7643 for more information or to make an appointment.
While youre with your loved one, please follow these guidelines:  No more than 2 visitors at the patients bedside at a time.  Use your cell phones at the elevator banks.
 Reassure your loved one of your support and presence.
 Touch and hold your loved ones hands.
 Talk to your loved one; remind him or her of the date and time.  Bring pictures, newspapers, a TV schedule, and a calendar.
 Respect the privacy of other patients in the ICU.
 Take home any patient belongings since space is limited.
Getting Information
We encourage you to ask questions. Family meetings can be planned with members of the ICU team, including the doctor, NP, nurse, and social worker.
We want to reassure family and friends of patients in the ICU, but we must also respect a patients privacy. The hospital follows the national standards for security and confidentiality of health information. These are the HIPAA standards. If necessary, we ask that there be
one contact person to receive information regarding your loved one. Information about the patient will be given to that person only. He or she should share any updates with the rest of the family or friends as the patient would wish. The contact person may call the ICU
4
at (212) 639-7555. He or she should also give the nurse his or her own contact information. That way, the nurse can call if there is a change in the patients condition. If possible, no calls should be made between 7:30 am  9:00 am and 7:30 pm  9:00 pm. This is the time when the nurses are busy exchanging information about the patients. If the nurses are busy providing patient care they may be unable to take your call at that time.
Caring for Yourself
Having a relative or friend in the ICU can be a very stressful experience. It is important that you take care of yourself. Your loved one needs you to be strong and well, both today and tomorrow. The following suggestions may help.
 Get some rest. Leave the hospital at night after visiting hours and try to sleep at home.
 Eat to maintain your strength. Eat regularly and drink plenty of fluids. You are welcome to use the hospitals cafeteria located on the first floor.
 Change your pace. For your well-being, try to spend some time outside the hospital. While your loved one is resting, you may want to go out to eat, or take a walk.
 Maintain contact with friends and family.
 Relax in the visitors lounge. Please feel free to use the computers and enjoy refreshments from the beverage area.
