<p>A GUIDE FOR PATIENTS
Living Beyond Cancer
adult survivorship program
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center is dedicated to
helping survivors live their lives after cancer to the fullest. The transition to survivorship care is a positive step that focuses on wellness, quality of life, and health promotion.
Our Survivorship Initiative addresses the physical, psychological, and information needs of patients who have completed treatment, and provides support for research to benefit survivors nationally. Relevant pro- grams for survivors of adult-onset cancer have been integrated into the overall care plan for all our patients.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Survivorship Care
What is survivorship care?
Survivorship care is designed to prevent, detect, and treat complica- tions resulting from cancer treatment. While we anticipate that most sur- vivors will lead healthy, active lives, some may develop problems as a result of their past diagnosis and its therapy. To maximize your health and well-being after the completion of cancer treatment, survivorship care will address and manage difficulties you may experience as a result of cancer or cancer treatment.
Who provides survivorship care?
Working closely with the doctors and nurses who treated you at MSKCC,
a nurse practitioner (NP) with special training in cancer survivorship will provide care following your treat- ment. Your visits will take place in the same area where the doctors and nurses who treated you are work- ing. Thus they are easily accessible should they be needed.
When does survivorship care begin?
Your doctor will determine when you are ready to transition to survivor- ship care. This decision is based, in part, on the particular type of cancer for which you have been treated and on the progress you’ve made during recovery from treatment.
What care is provided as part of a survivorship visit?
A visit with the survivorship NP includes the following:
i Review of your recent medical history and a physical examination
i Assessment to detect recurrence of cancer
i Identification and management of the effects of cancer and its treatment
i Screening referrals for other cancers
i Health promotion recommendations related to nutrition, exercise, and smoking cessation
i Treatment summary and follow-up care plan
i Consultation with your MSKCC physician as needed
How will your primary care physician be involved?
After your first survivorship visit, the NP will send a letter to your primary care physician summarizing your cancer treatment and outlining a plan for follow-up care. Your physi- cian can then incorporate this into your overall medical plan. After each subsequent visit, the NP will send
a report of your progress to your primary care physician.
As a leading cancer research institu- tion, MSKCC is committed to under- standing issues of particular impor- tance to cancer survivors. Current studies include assessing the long- term physical and emotional impact of specific cancer treatments and identifying ways to manage these. The knowledge gained from these studies will improve the quality of life for all cancer survivors.
