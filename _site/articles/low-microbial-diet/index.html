<div class="content">
<p>This information will help you follow a low microbial diet. Eating a low microbial diet will reduce your risk of getting ill while you have a weakened immune system, such as after chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a bone marrow transplant.</p>

<p>The first section of this booklet has information on how to keep your food safe. The second section explains what foods and beverages are safe to eat while on a low microbial diet. Dont make any changes to this diet until you have talked to someone on your healthcare team. This includes your doctor, nurse, nurse practitioner, or dietitian.</p>

<p>Food Safety Guidelines</p>

<p>What are microbes?</p>

<p>Microbes are tiny living organisms, such as bacteria, viruses, yeast, and molds. They can get into food by infecting the animal the food comes from. Microbes can also get into food when it is being processed or prepared. When microbes get into foods, they can cause infections, especially if you have a low white blood cell count (neutropenia).</p>

<p>Microbes can attach to foods and grow, but you cant always see, smell, or taste them. Microbes are more likely to grow on</p>

<ul>
<li>Milk and other dairy food items that are not refrigerated</li>
<li>Undercooked and raw eggs and foods that have raw eggs (e.g., cookie dough and Caesar salad dressing)</li>
<li>Undercooked or raw meat, poultry (chicken and turkey), and seafood</li>
<li>Certain fruits and vegetables (see the Fruits and Vegetable list in the What to Eat on a Low Microbial Diet section)</li>
<li>Unpasteurized or untreated juices (e.g., fresh-squeezed juices)</li>
<li>Vegetable sprouts (e.g., raw alfalfa, soy bean, and radish sprouts)</li>
</ul>


<p>Maintaining personal hygiene[SR1]</p>

<p>Always practice good personal hygiene to prevent infection. This includes always washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water in the following situations:
* Before preparing or eating food
* After preparing raw poultry, meat, fish, or seafood
* After using the bathroom
* After cleaning up a child
* After petting or cleaning up after an animal
* After blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing
* After handling garbage
* After treating a cut or wound</p>

<p>Buying foods that are safe to eat</p>

<ul>
<li>Dont buy canned foods if the can has dents or is swollen.</li>
<li>Dont buy food in jars if the jar is cracked or the lid is not tightly closed.</li>
<li>Only buy eggs that are refrigerated in the store. Check the eggs by opening the carton to see if any are broken or cracked. Separate ready-to-eat and raw foods. Put raw meat, poultry, seafood and other raw foods in plastic bags before they go into your shopping cart.</li>
<li>Pick up your milk and other cold foods at the end of your shopping trip. This decreases the time these items will spend outside of the refrigerator.</li>
<li>Check containers for the expiration date. Buy and use food before that date.</li>
</ul>


<p>Storing food safely</p>

<ul>
<li>Store food immediately after shopping.</li>
<li>Put eggs and milk inside the refrigerator; dont store them in the door. The temperature inside the refrigerator will stay cooler than in the door area.</li>
</ul>


<p>Keeping your kitchen clean</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep an area of your kitchen clean for preparing and eating food. This will help prevent the spread of microbes.</li>
<li>Use paper towels or clean cloths instead of sponges to clean kitchen surfaces.</li>
<li>Use an antibacterial cleansing spray to clean surfaces. Look for products that have bleach or ammonia. Examples are Lysol Food Surface Sanitizer and Clorox Clean-Up Cleaner.</li>
</ul>


<p>Using cutting boards and equipment</p>

<ul>
<li>Use cutting boards that are plastic, marble, glass, or ceramic. These materials are nonporous, meaning that food or liquid substances cant absorb into them. Avoid wood or other porous surfaces.</li>
<li>Wash cutting boards and knives with hot soapy water before using them to cut the next food. As an extra precaution, wash your cutting boards with a kitchen sanitizer. Throw out worn or hard-to-clean cutting boards.</li>
</ul>


<p>Handling food safely</p>

<ul>
<li>Thoroughly rinse fresh fruits and vegetables under running tap water. Rinse skins and rinds before cutting or peeling. Never use bleach or detergent to wash fresh fruits and vegetables.</li>
<li>Rub firm-skinned fruits and vegetables under running warm tap water or scrub them with a clean vegetable brush while rinsing with running tap water.</li>
<li>Remove and throw away any damaged or bruised areas on fruits or vegetables.</li>
<li>Cook all foods thoroughly.</li>
<li>Separate raw meats from ready-to-eat foods.</li>
<li>Thaw foods by using only 1 of the following methods:
o Put the food item in the refrigerator 1 day before cooking
o Use the defrost setting on a microwave. Cook right away.</li>
<li>Keep your refrigerator at a temperature of 33 F to 40F.</li>
<li>Keep your freezer at a temperature of 0 F or below.</li>
<li>Store leftovers in a shallow container. To cool them faster, put them in the freezer or refrigerator as soon as you finish eating. Use them within 2 days to prevent spoilage.</li>
<li>Use a food thermometer to test the temperatures of cooked and reheated foods.</li>
<li>Dont eat hamburgers and other meat products if the meat looks undercooked. Cook the meat until it is grey and the juices run clear.</li>
<li>Cook fish until it flakes.</li>
<li>Cook egg whites and yolks until they are firm.</li>
<li>Cook all meats to the temperatures listed in the chart below.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eating leftovers</p>

<ul>
<li>Refrigerate leftovers immediately after eating.</li>
<li>Put the leftovers in shallow dishes before refrigerating so that it cools quickly.</li>
<li>Leftovers should be reheated to the proper internal temperature, based on the Reheating Guidelines below. Use a food thermometer to check the internal temperature.</li>
<li>Sauces, soups, and gravies should be reheated by bringing them to a boil.</li>
<li>When microwaving food or reheating leftovers, stir, cover, and rotate food for even heating. Heat food until it reaches at least 165 F throughout, as measured with a food thermometer.</li>
<li>Be sure to let the food cool so you dont burn your mouth.</li>
<li>Eat reheated leftover foods within 1 hour.</li>

<p>Always remember: when in doubt, throw it out!</p>

<p>Avoid herbal supplements</p>

<p>Dont take homeopathic remedies or herbal products (e.g., traditional Chinese medicines). Because there are no federal standards for these products in the US, the way they are processed and stored may pose a health risk. Microbes in these items can also cause an infection. Also, the products themselves could interfere with or change the activity of a prescription medication.</p>

<p>Safe drinking water</p>

<ul>
<li>Never drink from lakes, rivers, streams, springs or wells.</li>
<li>If you are unsure if the tap water is safe, check with the local health department or boil or filter the water. Drink bottled water if you think the tap water may not be safe.</li>
</ul>


<p>Eating out at restaurants</p>

<p>You can eat out while on a low microbial diet, as long as you choose the restaurant carefully. Local health departments inspect restaurants to make sure that they are clean, and that they follow safe food practices. You can find out how your local restaurants did on a recent health inspection by going to your local Department of Health (DOH) website. To find out about restaurants in New York City, go to http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/rii/index.shtml.
You can also ask your local restaurants about their food safety training rules. When you go out to eat, follow the guidelines below.</p>

<ul>
<li>Order all foods to be fully cooked and meat to be well done.</li>
<li>Dont order foods that may have raw eggs (e.g., Caesar salad dressing and hollandaise sauce).</li>
<li>Ask the waitstaff if you are not sure of the ingredients in your meal.</li>
<li>Dont eat foods from buffets and salad bars.</li>
<li>Ask that your foods be cooked fresh and not served from steam tables and heat lamps.</li>
<li>Ask for single-serving condiments, such as catsup and mustard packets. Open containers may be used by many customers.</li>
<li>Dont eat soft serve ice cream and soft serve frozen yogurt. The dispensers may not be cleaned on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Always order a whole or personal pizza. Dont order individual slices, since they are often stored under heat lamps.</li>
</ul>
