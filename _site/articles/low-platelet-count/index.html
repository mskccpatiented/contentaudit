<p>Platelets are colorless cells that are a part of blood.  They are produced in bone marrow, the soft, spongy center in most of our large bones.  The main function of platelets is to control bleeding.  A normal platelet count is 150,000-400,000 platelets per microliter (mcl) of blood. Your doctor monitors your platelet count using a blood test called a complete blood count (CBC).</p>

<p>Platelet counts may be low because of cancer or because of the treatment for cancer. If your doctor has told you that you have a low platelet count, it is very important that you take precautions to prevent bleeding.
