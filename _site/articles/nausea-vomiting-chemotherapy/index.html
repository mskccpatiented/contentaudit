<p>Nausea and Vomiting Due to Chemotherapy
This information will help you manage nausea and vomiting due to chemotherapy.
Nausea and vomiting can be caused by chemotherapy drugs irritating the areas of the brain that control nausea and the cells that line the digestive tract (mouth, throat, stomach, and intestines). Nausea and vomiting can also be caused by stress or just the thought of having chemotherapy.
It is important to manage nausea because it can keep you from eating and drinking. When you dont eat or drink enough, your body doesnt get the vitamins and nutrients it needs. You need these to give you energy and help you heal.
Managing Nausea and Vomiting
Medication
If nausea and vomiting are a problem for you, your doctor will give you medication that can help prevent or control nausea. You may get these before, at the time of, or after your chemotherapy. You will also get a prescription for medication to take home with you. Take your medication as directed by your doctor or nurse. You may have been told to take it on a regular schedule, even if you are not feeling nauseous. Or, you may have been told to take it as soon as you feel nauseous. In either case, take it on time and dont wait.
These medications work differently for different patients. If the medication you are taking doesnt work, tell your doctor or nurse. You may need to try a different medication or take more than 1 kind to feel better. Your doctor and nurse will try to find the medication that works best for you.
There are 2 medications commonly given for nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy: aprepitant (Emend) and dexamethasone (Decadron).
If your doctor gives you prescriptions for aprepitant, fill each prescription at least 7 days before your next treatment. The medication will come in a
1
pack that contains 3 tablets (tri-pack): one 125 mg tablet and two 80 mg tablets. Bring the tri-pack with you to each chemotherapy treatment.
Take your medication as directed below. If you have any questions, please call your doctors nurse.

<p>Eating and drinking
 Drink at least 8 to 10, 8-ounce glasses of liquids per day. Drink slowly and in small amounts at least 1 hour before or after your mealtimes.
 Try drinking cool, clear, unsweetened fruit juices or light- colored sodas that have lost their fizz.
 Choose drinks that dont have caffeine, which can make you dehydrated.
 Eat small, frequent meals.
 Avoid eating foods that give off an odor and are fried, greasy, creamy, rich, or spicy.
 Eat your meals slowly and at room temperature or cold. This will help if you are bothered by strong smells. Odors from cooking or hot meals can make you nauseous.
 Chew your food well and sit upright for 2 hours after eating. This can help with digestion.
 To help prevent dry heaves or nausea in the morning, try eating dry foods before getting up. You can try crackers, cereal, or toast.
 Suck on hard candy, such as mints or tart candies.
 Eat a light meal before your chemotherapy treatment.
 Be sure to brush your teeth and keep your mouth clean. Rinse out your mouth after vomiting.
 Ask your doctor or nurse to schedule an appointment for you with a dietitian. A dietitian can help you maintain your nutrition and eat well during your treatment.
