<h3>What Is Protected Walking?</h3>

<p>Protected walking is a kind of careful, limited walking. Your doctor may prescribe protected walking for different reasons, including a fracture (broken bone) or possible fracture of your hip, leg, or foot. It can also be prescribed for thigh or leg surgery. A brace, cast, or splint may be used along with a walking aid, such as crutches, a cane, or a walker.</p>

<p>It is important to follow your doctors instructions to protect your leg or hip. A physical therapist will teach you how to walk correctly. He/she will also adjust your cane, walker, or crutches to the height that works best for you or will teach you how to make these adjustments.</p>
