<p>This information describes the risk factors, prevention, symptoms, and treatment of radiation fibrosis syndrome.</p>

<p>Radiation therapy is an effective treatment for certain cancers. However, it can also cause inflammation and damage to nearby blood vessels that feed muscles, nerves, and bones. When these parts of the body don't receive enough blood, fibrous tissue develops in places where it shouldn't be. This is called radiation fibrosis syndrome. It can develop soon after or sometimes years after radiation therapy.</p>

<h3>Risk Factors</h3>

<p>Not all patients treated with radiation therapy will develop radiation fibrosis syndrome. There are no good estimates as to how many patients will develop it, but there are some risk factors that make someone more likely to develop it. These factors include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The type and amount of radiation therapy</li>
<li>Area of the body receiving radiation therapy</li>
<li>Age during treatment</li>
<li>The use of other medications and treatments (e.g., chemotherapy and steroids)</li>
<li>Surgery or past radiation therapy to the treatment site</li>
<li>Other health conditions, such as diabetes, spinal degenerative disorders, and rheumatologic disorders</li>
<li>Genetics</li>
</ul>


<h3>Prevention</h3>

<p>Radiation oncologists try to prevent radiation fibrosis syndrome by delivering higher doses of radiation to a tumor, while decreasing the doses to normal tissue. Even using the best techniques and equipment, radiation fibrosis can still develop in some patients.</p>

<p>Before treatment, patients are taught how to do stretching exercises to the area being treated to help prevent radiation fibrosis syndrome. These exercises must be done before, during, and after treatment.</p>

<p>For patients at high risk for radiation fibrosis syndrome, early diagnosis and monitoring by a doctor is important. This is so that any lifestyle changes to decrease risk factors for heart and lung diseases (e.g., tobacco cessation, glucose control, decrease cholesterol), as well for a second kind of cancer (e.g., breast or prostate cancer screening) can be started. Nerve, muscle, and pain problems can be managed by starting physical and occupational therapy early.</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<p>Radiation fibrosis syndrome can cause a wide variety of symptoms. Some of these include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scarred skin that is stiff and tough</li>
<li>Lymphedema (swelling) on the face, body, arms, and legs</li>
<li>Pain</li>
<li>Difficulty moving joints and muscles</li>
<li>Decreased strength in joints and muscles</li>
<li>Ulcerations[SR1]</li>
<li>Head and neck problems</li>
<li>Taste changes</li>
<li>Difficulty opening the mouth (trismus)</li>
<li>Trouble moving the neck or supporting the head</li>
<li>Lung problems</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Increased risk for lung infections</li>
<li>Heart problems</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Feeling tired easily</li>
<li>Fast heart rate</li>
<li>Chest pain</li>
<li>Heart palpitations</li>
<li>Digestive problems</li>
<li>Obstructions (blockage in the intestines)</li>
<li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
<li>Ulcers</li>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Urinary tract problems</li>
<li>Increased urination</li>
<li>Difficulty urinating</li>
</ul>


<h3>Treatment</h3>

<p>There is no cure for radiation fibrosis syndrome, but physical function and quality of life can usually be improved with treatment. The type of treatment depends on the parts of the body that are affected. Overall, the goal of treatment is to return patients to their previous levels of physical, psychological, and social functioning.</p>

<h4>Physical and occupational therapy</h4>

<p>Two of the most successful treatments for radiation fibrosis syndrome are physical and occupational therapy. Physical and occupational therapists develop a treatment plan based upon the unique needs of each patient. For example, special types of massage can be done to reduce the effects of radiation fibrosis syndrome in many areas of the body. Once blood flow to a part of a patients body is improved, the therapist can perform stretching, strengthening, and nerve re-training exercises. These exercises can improve skin and muscle movement, as well as muscle strength and coordination.</p>

<h4>Medications</h4>

<ul>
<li>A number of oral (taken by mouth) and topical (rubbed on the skin) medications can be prescribed to manage the pain and spasms resulting from radiation fibrosis syndrome.</li>
<li>In some patients, injections are used to treat muscle, bone, and nerve pain, muscle spasms, and muscle stiffness. Other medications are being tested to treat radiation fibrosis syndrome in the soft tissue and lungs.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Surgeries and procedures</h4>

<ul>
<li>Dilation and insertion of stents (e.g., in the trachea or esophagus) are procedures that can be used to unblock tubes and tracts within the body.</li>
<li>Some surgeries and procedures may be considered for certain complications. However, areas of the body treated with radiation therapy may heal poorly and develop more complications. As a result, surgeries and procedures are very rarely used to treat the condition. Your doctor can tell you about the risks and benefits of having a surgery or procedure.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Other treatments</h4>

<ul>
<li>Assistive devices can be prescribed to improve joint function and balance.</li>
<li>Jaw stretching devices for trismus can be prescribed.</li>
<li>Therapy can be performed to reduce lymphedema in the face and body.</li>
</ul>

<p>[SR1]Are there any particular places on the body where this would occur?
[b2]Any ideas for how this should end?</p>
