<p>Sex is an important part of life for many people. You can be sexually active during your cancer treatment, but it is important to do this safely by taking steps to protect yourself and your partner.</p>

<p>Please let your doctor or nurse know if you have questions about this information. If you have any concerns about how to follow the recommendations below based on your religious observances, we suggest you speak with your religious leader.</p>

<h4>Use Birth Control to Prevent Pregnancy</h4>

<p>If a woman becomes pregnant with sperm damaged by exposure to radiation, chemotherapy, or other anticancer medications, there is a risk of miscarriage or birth defects. If your partner is a female who could become pregnant, use contraception (birth control) throughout your cancer treatment. Do not rely on withdrawing before ejaculation (pulling out) or on avoiding sex during fertile times of her menstrual cycle (rhythm method). These are not effective in preventing pregnancy.</p>

<p>There are different types of birth control you can consider.
* If you have only 1 female partner, ask her to see a gynecologist to help her select a method of birth control that will be successful for her. Examples include birth control pills, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and diaphragms.
* If your partner chooses not to use birth control, or if you have more than 1 female partner, use a condom each time you have sex. Condoms not only prevent pregnancy, but they also protect you from sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. See "Barrier Devices" below for information on buying and using condoms.</p>

<p>If you are getting chemotherapy or radiation directed to an area near your testes, continue to use birth control for at least 1 year after your treatment has ended. This allows time for damaged sperm to clear from your body. If you plan to have children after treatment, ask your doctor when it is safe for you to start trying. Depending on your situation, your doctor may recommend you wait more or less time.</p>

<p>Some treatments may affect your fertility (ability to get a woman pregnant). If you have questions about this, ask your doctor or nurse.</p>

<h4>Take Precautions to Protect Yourself from Infection or Bleeding</h4>

<p>Patients with multiple partners are at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV. In addition, certain cancer treatments can cause low blood cell counts for prolonged periods of time, which may increase your risk of infection or bleeding. Your doctor or nurse will let you know if this is a concern for you. To prevent infection or bleeding:</p>

<ul>
<li>Wash your hands and genitals before and after having vaginal, oral, or anal sex.</li>
<li>If you have sex with men, or if you have a female partner who is using birth control, consider using a condom each time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex throughout your treatment. Condoms protect you from STIs, including HIV. This is particularly important if you have more than 1 partner.</li>
<li>If you are expected to have very low blood cell counts for a prolonged period of time, your doctor or nurse may advise you to use a barrier device during sex - condoms or dental dams. See "Barrier Devices" below.
o In some situations, you may even be advised to avoid sex that involves penetration or contact with mucous membranes while your counts are low. This includes vaginal, oral, and anal sex or inserting fingers, vibrators, or sexual toys into your anus.
o Hugging, cuddling, gentle touching, and kissing skin are other ways you can be intimate with your partner during this time.</li>
<li>Some men develop yeast infections under the foreskin of the penis during treatment, especially if they are taking steroids or antibiotics. Symptoms include itching, irritation, and discharge from the penis. If you suspect you have a yeast infection, avoid sex and call your doctor or nurse.</li>
<li>If you have had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, you are at increased risk of infection for many months after your treatment. Until your doctor tells you that your immune system has recovered</li>
<li>Use latex condoms each time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex.</li>
<li>Use a barrier device (condoms or dental dams) any time your partners saliva, vaginal secretions, or semen could enter your mouth. See "Barrier Devices" below.</li>
<li>Abstain from any sexual activity that could expose your mouth to feces.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Consider Taking Precautions to Protect Your Partner From Exposure to Chemotherapy and Other Anticancer Medications</h4>

<p>There is little information about how much anticancer medication gets into a mans semen. There is even less information on whether this poses any risk to a sexual partner. Regardless of your partner's age or gender, consider using a condom whenever your semen could enter your partner's vagina, mouth, or anus. This will prevent your partner from being exposed to any medication that may be in your semen. We don't know how long these drugs may be in semen, but we suggest you consider using a condom each day you have chemotherapy and for 1 week afterward. See "Barrier Devices below for more information.</p>

<h3>Barrier Devices</h3>

<h4>Condoms</h4>

<ul>
<li>You can buy condoms at any drug store. We recommend latex condoms, but if you or your partner is allergic to latex, use polyurethane condoms.</li>
<li>Spermicides do not provide any added protection.</li>
<li>You can use lubricated condoms or a separate water- or silicone-based lubricant.</li>
<li>Before you use a condom, check the expiration date on the wrapper. Expired condoms are more likely to break.</li>
</ul>


<p>To use a condom correctly:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be careful when opening and handling the condom. Don't use your teeth, scissors, or other sharp objects to open the wrapper. Don't use the condom if it is torn, brittle, or stiff.</li>
<li>Wait until your penis becomes firm before putting on the condom.</li>
<li>While pinching the tip of the condom, unroll it over your penis as far as it will go. This extra space at the tip is needed to collect your semen.</li>
<li>Smooth out any air bubbles - they can cause condoms to break.</li>
<li>After you have ejaculated, but before your penis becomes soft, hold the base of the condom (where the ring is) and carefully pull your penis out of your partner so that nothing spills.</li>
<li>Carefully slide off the condom and throw it in the trash.</li>
<li>A condom can tear if it is too tight or it can fall off if it is too loose. If this happens while you are having vaginal sex, and your partner is of childbearing age, have her call a gynecologist. She should ask about emergency contraception (the morning-after pill) if she is not using another form of birth control.</li>
</ol>


<h4>Dental dams</h4>

<ul>
<li>A dental dam is a thin, rectangular sheet of latex or silicone that covers the genitals of a woman receiving oral sex.</li>
<li>You can buy these online, get them from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, or make one out of a condom.</li>
<li>If you want to make a dental dam out of a condom, you may want to avoid those with a spermicide or lubricant, as the taste may be unpleasant. Cut off the tip and cut down the side of the tube to make a sheet.</li>
<li>To use a dental dam, have your female partner hold the sheet over her vulva or anus while you are giving her oral sex.</li>
</ul>
