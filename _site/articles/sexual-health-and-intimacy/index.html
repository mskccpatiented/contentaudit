<p>It is common for people to feel changes in their body during and after cancer treatment. There may be things you can see right away, like surgical scars, drainage tubes, and venous catheters. You may experience a loss of hair, a change in your weight, pain, or fatigue. These physical changes may affect how you feel about yourself or how you relate to your partner. They can affect your interest in sexual activity. They may also lessen your enjoyment and pleasure. During this time, there are things you can do to help you adjust and cope. Some suggestions, services, and resources are listed below.</p>
