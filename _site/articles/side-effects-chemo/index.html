<h1>Side Effects from Chemo</h1>

<h4>Side Effects of Chemotherapy</h4>

<p>Your chemotherapy will kill the cancerous cells in your body and will prepare your bone marrow to receive your transplant. However, the side effects associated with chemotherapy are not to be taken lightly. These side effects will include the loss of your ability to heal and fight infections, infertility, hair loss, fatigue, nausea, mouth sores, and mouth tenderness.</p>

<p>Your healthcare team will help you understand and prepare for these side effects. Before you receive your chemotherapy, make a list of questions that you would like to ask about these side effects. Talk through these questions with your caregiver and your healthcare team.</p>

<h4>Neutropenia</h4>

<p>Your chemotherapy will severely damage your ability to fight infections and heal. It's important that you understand why this happens, how to watch for danger signs, and how to avoid infections and injuries.</p>

<p>One side effect of chemotherapy is called neutropenia. Neutropenia is a condition where you have a a lower than normal number of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in your bloodstream. Neutrophils play a crucial role in your immune system&mdash;they are one of the first types of cells that travel to the site of an infection. Once they reach the site of an infection, they ingest and fight potentially harmful microorganisms.</p>

<p>Because your chemotherapy will kill your stem cells, you will lose the ability to make new neutrophils. Because your neutrophils are not being replaced the number of neutrophils in your bloodstream will drop to a very low level, leaving you at high risk of infections. You and your caregiver will work together to watch for any sign of infection. You'll keep a record of your temperature even when you are in your hotel or apartment and you will have to take very careful precautions to avoid infections.</p>

<h4>Low Platelet Level (Thrombocytopenia)</h4>

<p>In addition to losing your ability to make neutrophils and other types of white blood cells, you'll also lose your ability to make platelets. Platelets clump together to help stop bleeding.  After your chemotherapy the number of platelets in your bloodstream will be very low, a condition called thrombocytopenia.</p>

<p>You will need to take special care to avoid cuts and strenuous activities that might cause bleeding. You need to take special care of your gums and mouth, because it's quite common for bleeding to start there.</p>

<p>After your transplant your healthcare team will take samples of your blood each day to count the number of neutrophils and platelets in your bloodstream.</p>

<p>As your stem cells take hold and start to make new blood cells, the number of neutrophils in your bloodstream (sometimes referred to as your absolute neutrophil count or ANC) will increase, as will your number of platelets (called your platelet count). These are collectively known as "your counts" and they are key signs that your transplant has worked. You'll hear the term counts used frequently by your healthcare team.</p>

<p>More in-depth guides to living with neutropenia and low platelet levels are included later in this guide under Phase 3: After Your Transplant.</p>

<h4>Fatigue</h4>

<p>After your chemotherapy, the number of red blood cells in your blood will be very low.</p>

<p>Red blood cells are the cells that transport oxygen around your body. Because the number of red blood cells in your blood will be low, oxygen will not travel around your body as easily as before. This will mean that you will feel tired. Your caregiver will need to help you carry out day-to-day activities until your red blood cell count returns to normal. Don't be afraid to ask for help, even with things you used to do with ease.</p>

<p>Even though you will feel tired after your chemotherapy and your transplant, you should still try to remain active.</p>

<h4>Nausea and Vomiting</h4>

<p>Nausea and vomiting are common side effects of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy acts on a specific part of your brain that may trigger nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting can also be caused by stress or just the thought of having chemotherapy. The amount of nausea and vomiting you have will depend on your past experience and the type of chemotherapy you will receive. Sometimes, you may experience nausea during your chemotherapy treatment, or it may be delayed for several hours or days. It is important to manage nausea because it can keep you from eating and drinking.</p>

<p>You will be given medication to prevent and control nausea prior to receiving chemotherapy. You will also be given a prescription for anti-nausea medication to take home with you. These medications work differently for each person. If the medication you are taking isn't helping, tell your NP or doctor. You may need to try a different medication or take more than 1 kind of anti-nausea medication to feel better. Your healthcare team will work with you to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting.</p>

<h4>Diarrhea</h4>

<p>Diarrhea is frequent, loose, watery bowel movements. It can also cause stomach cramps, gas, and pain in the stomach or rectal area. Diarrhea can be caused by cancer treatments, medications, infection, stress, or other medical conditions. If you are having diarrhea you may become dehydrated due to loss of fluids and electrolytes. If your diarrhea continues for more than 24 hours, call your doctor or NP. Medications are available to treat diarrhea but do not take any over-the-counter medication until you have been evaluated by your nurse practitioner or doctor.</p>

<h4>Constipation</h4>

<p>Constipation is the passage of dry, hard stool that occurs when materials move too slowly through the large intestine. The normal length of time between bowel movements varies for each person. If you are having fewer bowel movements than what is normal for you, or if you haven't had a bowel movement for more than 2 days you are probably constipated. There are many causes of constipation including not drinking enough fluids or eating enough fiber, a decrease in your activity, not moving around or walking enough, and side effects of certain medications and chemotherapy drugs. Medications are available to treat constipation. Talk to your NP or doctor if you haven't had a bowel movement for 2 days.</p>

<h4>Mouth Sores</h4>

<p>Some chemotherapy drugs affect the cells that line the mouth and digestive tract. This is known as mucositis. Mucositis can cause redness, swelling, tenderness and sores on the lining of your mouth, tongue, and lips. You may experience some mouth and throat discomfort that can make it difficult to eat or swallow.</p>

<h4>Skin Changes</h4>

<p>Skin changes are common after transplant due to the effects of cancer treatment. Skin changes include increased dryness, flaking, discoloration, and darkening. Your skin will be very sensitive to the sun and may sunburn very easily. Avoid bright sunlight and when outdoors, wear sun block (SPF 30) and protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and a hat.</p>

<h4>Hair Loss</h4>

<p>The chemotherapy that cancer cells also kills the cells that produce your hair. Most patients will lose their hair during their transplant.</p>

<p>Losing your hair can be an unpleasant and upsetting experience. Like many patients, you may choose to cut your hair short before your transplant to take control of this process and to lessen the shock of losing your hair. Talk this through with your caregiver, friends and family.</p>

<p>Before your transplant is also a good time to think about whether you would like to wear a wig. Modern wigs can look very natural and wearing one might make you feel more comfortable. There are many wig stores in New York, a list of them is provided at the back of this guide. You can one while you still have your hair, or with a clipping of your hair, if you'd like your wig to match your natural hair.</p>

<h4>Changes to Sexual Activity</h4>

<p>Sexual intimacy provides pleasure and comfort for many people after their treatment. The information below can serve as a guide to being sexually active in a safe way after your transplant. You may have questions or concerns regarding your sexual activity. You are encouraged to discuss your concerns openly with your physician, NP, or nurse.</p>

<h5>Birth control</h5>

<p>Although infertility is likely you or your partner should use contraception (birth control) during and after your chemotherapy. If a woman becomes pregnant with sperm or eggs damaged by exposure to radiation, chemotherapy, or other anticancer medications, there is a risk of miscarriage or birth defects.</p>

<p>It's important to pick a method of birth control that fits your lifestyle and will be effective. When used correctly, condoms are very effective in preventing pregnancy. Women can speak with their gynecologists to choose between the many available options.</p>

<h5>Precautions to observe to avoid exposing your partner to chemotherapy and other anticancer medications</h5>

<p>There is little information about how much anticancer medication gets into a person's body fluids, and even less on whether this poses any risk to a sexual partner. If this is a concern for you, consider using a barrier device whenever your partner may have contact with your semen (if you are male) or vaginal fluids (if you are female). Barrier devices include condoms and dental dams. We don't know how long these medications may be in body fluids, but you should use barrier devices each day you have chemotherapy and for 1 week afterward.</p>

<h5>Protecting yourself from infection or bleeding during sex</h5>

<p>You will be at increased risk of infection during your transplant period and for many months after your treatment.</p>

<p>Until your doctor tells you that your blood counts and immune system have recovered, follow these precautions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid sex that involves penetration or contact with mucous membranes while your blood counts are low (your platelet count needs to be greater than 50,000). This includes vaginal, oral, and anal sex or inserting fingers, vibrators or sex toys into your vagina or anus.</li>
<li>Use latex condoms each time you have vaginal, oral or anal sex.</li>
<li>Use a barrier device (condoms or dental dams) any time your partner's saliva, vaginal secretions, or semen could enter your mouth.</li>
<li>Abstain from any sexual activity that could expose your mouth to feces.</li>
<li>Avoid sex that involves contact with mucous membranes if a genital infection is suspected or present in either you or your partner.</li>
</ul>


<p>Hugging, cuddling, gentle touching, and kissing skin are other ways you can be intimate with your partner during this time.

<li><em>Sexuality for the Woman with Cancer and Her Partner</em></li>
</ul>


<h4>The Importance of Communication</h4>

<p>Throughout your treatment, it's very important that you communicate clearly with your healthcare team and your caregiver about your side effects.</p>

<p>Tell your healthcare team how you're feeling. Describe how your body feels. Describe how you're doing emotionally. Tell them if anything is worrying you. If you notice changes in how you feel, describe what has changed. If anything bothers you, even if it seems minor, tell your healthcare team. The more information you can communicate to your healthcare team the more they'll be able to help you. There is usually something that they can do to make you feel more comfortable.</p>
