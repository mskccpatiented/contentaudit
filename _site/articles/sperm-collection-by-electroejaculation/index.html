<div class="content">
<p>EEJ is a procedure to collect sperm for analysis, freezing, and storage. It is for men who are unable to collect sperm by massaging or stimulating the penis to ejaculation. EEJ uses a mild electric current to cause an ejaculation.</p>

<p>Before the Procedure
EEJ is performed in the Surgical Day Hospital. Please speak with your doctor or nurse about how you should prepare for surgery.</p>

<p>Description of the Procedure
* You will be given general anesthesia so you will be asleep during the procedure.
* A catheter is placed in your bladder to drain out the urine. A solution will then be put into your bladder to lower the acid level. This protects any sperm that may pass into your bladder when you ejaculate.
* The doctor places a probe into your rectum.
* A mild electrical current is delivered through the probe. This is repeated every few seconds and slowly increased until you ejaculate.
* All semen is collected. This includes the semen from your penis and any that may have passed into your bladder.
* The probe and catheter are removed.
* You will recover in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit until you wake up. Then you will be discharged home.
The semen is placed into vials and will be delivered to The Sperm Bank of New York where they will analyze the specimen. If there are enough sperm, the semen will be transferred to their affiliated New Jersey sperm bank for freezing and storage. The address of the sperm bank where your semen will be stored is:
The Sperm and Embryo Bank of New Jersey
187 Mill Lane
Mountainside, NJ  07092
908-654-8836</p>

<p>After the Procedure
Instructions
There is a risk of developing a urinary tract infection. To prevent this:
* You will be given a prescription for antibiotics. Take them for three days after the procedure. Take all the medicine that is prescribed.
* Drink extra fluid for three days after the procedure. Drink enough so that your urine is almost clear.
What to Expect
* Burning with urination for three days after the procedure
Call Your Doctor If You Have:
* Burning with urination that lasts longer than three days.
* Blood in your urine.
* A fever over 101¡F (38.3¡C).
* Chills.
Follow Up
* Call your doctor two days after the procedure to get the result of your semen analysis. If there were not enough sperm to freeze, ask your doctor if there are other ways of collecting sperm that could work for you.</p>
