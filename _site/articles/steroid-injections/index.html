Day of Your Procedure
Your doctor will go over the risks and benefits of having the steroid injection and ask you to sign a consent form.
You will be given a gown and asked to remove any clothing that covers the affected joint. You will be put in
a position that allows your doctor to give you your injection. He or she may use an ultrasound to help find the best place for your injection. Your doctor will then clean the area and inject a mixture of the steroid and a numbing medication.
Most patients say that the injection is not painful. Any discomfort should go away in a few minutes as the numbing medication starts working. The numbing medication usually wears off in 6 to 8 hours. At this time, you may feel some soreness in your joint. It may last for up to 48 hours until the steroid medication starts to work.
Use cold packs to help reduce any discomfort. You can use them several times a day as needed on a schedule of no more than 10 minutes on and 10 minutes off. Do not use them if you have
• Problems with blood supply such as Raynaud’s Disease • Problems related to poor circulation
• Nerve problems with poor sensation
After Your Procedure
• Keep a dry and clean bandage/Band-Aid® over the injection site for 24 hours.
• The site may be sore for a few days. Ask your doctor about taking pain medication. • Ask your doctor if there are any activities or movements that you should avoid.
• Do not use hot/warm packs on the site for 24 hours after your injection.
