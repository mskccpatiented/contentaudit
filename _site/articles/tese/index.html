<div class="content">
<p>TESE is a procedure to collect sperm directly from the testes if no sperm are found in the semen. This may be needed because:
• The testes are not able to make enough sperm to find in the semen.
• There is a blockage that prevents sperm from passing out of the penis during ejaculation.
Men may have this procedure done before cancer treatment, to preserve their fertility potential, or after cancer treatment, to attempt fathering a child.
Before the Procedure
TESE is performed in the Surgical Day Hospital. Please speak with your doctor or nurse about how you should prepare for surgery.
Description of the Procedure
• You will be given general anesthesia so you will be asleep during the procedure.
• The doctor makes a very small incision in your scrotum.
• The testes are examined using a tiny surgical microscope to locate areas where sperm may be found.
• Small pieces of tissue are removed from the testes.
• The incision is closed with sutures.
• A compression dressing will be placed around your scrotum. A scrotal support will be put on to hold this in place.
• You will recover in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit until you wake up. Then you will be discharged home.
The pieces of tissue that were removed are broken into pieces and placed into vials. These will be delivered
to The Sperm Bank of New York where they will analyze the sample. If sperm are found, the tissue will be transferred to their affiliated New Jersey sperm bank for freezing and storage. The address of the sperm bank is:
The Sperm and Embryo Bank of New Jersey 187 Mill Lane
Mountainside, NJ 07092
908-654-8836</p>

<p>After the Procedure
What to expect
• Mild pain and tenderness in your scrotum for a few days. You will be given a prescription for pain medicine. Take this as directed.
• Mild bruising (“black and blue” appearance) on your scrotum and penis.
How to care for your scrotum
For the first 2 days after surgery:
• Keep the compression dressing in place.
• Keep the scrotal support in place.
• Apply cold packs against the dressing (outside of the dressing but inside the scrotal support). Keep these on continuously for 48 hours except for when you sleep.
On the third day after surgery:
• Remove the scrotal support and dressing. Take a shower.
• Reapply the scrotal support and keep it on continuously for 1 week. You can remove it when you shower.
Activity
• For the first 2 days after surgery, stay off your feet as much as you can. You can walk short distances within your home. You can climb stairs as needed.
• When sitting, elevate your legs.
• Do not drive while you are taking pain medicine.
• Do not lift any heavy objects (10 pounds or greater) for at least 2 weeks after surgery.
￼Call your doctor if you have:
• A fever over 101°F (38.3°C).
• Pain not relived by your pain medicine.</p>
