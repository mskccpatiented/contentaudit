<p>In our Survivorship Program, nurse practitioners provide follow-up care for patients who have been treated for cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Nurse practitioners are registered nurses who have completed advanced education and training, and have been part of the healthcare team at MSKCC since the 1970s.
If you choose to continue your care in our Survivorship Program, your nurse practitioner will work directly with the doctor(s) who treated you to help you manage your life after cancer. You will see your nurse practitioner in our Survivorship clinic, where he or she will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Look for signs of the cancer returning.</li>
<li>Manage any effects of treatment, such as pain and fatigue.</li>
<li>Recommend screening tests for other cancers.</li>
<li>Provide counseling about living a healthy lifestyle, such as diet, exercise, and quitting smoking.</li>
<li>Provide your local doctor with information about your treatment.</li>
</ul>


<p>During visits with your nurse practitioner, he or she will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Talk with you about your medical history.</li>
<li>Perform a physical exam.</li>
<li>Order tests, such as x-rays, scans, and blood tests.</li>
<li>Make referrals to other healthcare providers, if needed.</li>
<li>Prescribe medicine, if needed.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you would like more information about our Survivorship Program, talk with your doctor or nurse.</p>

<p>If you are being cared for in our Survivorship Program and have any questions, talk with your nurse practitioner.</p>
