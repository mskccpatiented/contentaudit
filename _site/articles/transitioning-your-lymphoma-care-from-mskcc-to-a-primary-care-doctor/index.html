<div class="content">
<p>At MSKCC we have a plan of care for our patients who have completed treatment for lymphoma. This plan is based on your individual needs. You have passed the time when most problems from lymphoma occur. As a result, you no longer need the care of lymphoma specialists. You are ready to transition your care to your local primary care doctor.
As scary as this may seem, this is good news!
Since you completed treatment for lymphoma, you have been receiving follow-up care from your lymphoma doctor. You may have had visits with more than one doctor depending on the treatments you received. Your lymphoma doctor focused on your long-term physical and emotional needs, such as taking care of any effects from your treatment.  After each of these visits, your lymphoma doctor sent information to your local primary care doctor. This was done to keep your local doctor informed so that at some time all your care could be transferred there.</p>

<p>Frequently Asked Questions
How will my primary care doctor know about my lymphoma treatment?
