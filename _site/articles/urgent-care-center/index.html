What is the Urgent Care Center?
The Urgent Care Center (UCC) is an emergency room for MSKCC patients. It is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The staff evaluates and manages problems related to:
 Cancer.

 A fever.
 Active bleeding.
 Flu-like symptoms, such as a cough, fever, or chills.  Any other medical issues of personal concern.
Your doctor may also decide after talking with you on the phone that you should be admitted to the hospital. In this case, you go through the UCC.
At the UCC, you can get medicine by vein or a blood transfusion. The staff is also trained to deal with infusion chemotherapy and other home medical equipment problems.
Always go to the closest emergency room if you have a life-threatening emergency.
Where is the Urgent Care Center located?
It is on the first floor of Memorial Hospital. The closest entrance is 425 East 67th Street. This entrance is open Monday through Friday, from 6 am until 12 am At other times go through the 1275 York Avenue entrance and ask for directions.
How do I arrange to be seen in the Urgent Care Center?

After 5 pm and on weekends, call the page operator at (212) 639-7900. Ask to speak with the doctor on call covering your doctor. Your doctor may decide that you need to go to the UCC. In that case, he or she will tell the Center that you are coming.
What happens to me once I get there?
Once you arrive, the nurse and doctor will try to see you as soon as possible. Once you are registered, you will wait to see the triage nurse. After this you may have blood tests, x-rays, and other tests. You will likely return to the waiting area. As soon as an examination bed is available, you will be seen by an Urgent Care doctor. This process helps us make sure that critically ill patients are seen first.

Although your doctor may have arranged for you to go to the UCC in order to be admitted, your hospital bed may not be ready. The Urgent Care staff will decide what care you need. When possible, they will begin it while you wait. We will let you know as best we can about when you will be able to go to your inpatient room.
I was here first! Why was that patient seen before me?
Our goal is to have you in your inpatient bed or discharged as soon as possible. Based on factors like bed availabili- ty and test result wait time we cannot tell you the exact amount of time you will wait. Many factors go into priori- tizing patients, ranging from chief complaint to lab values. We thank you for your patience in this matter. Also, remember that you may be taken ahead of others waiting if you need to be seen first.
Can my family visit me in Urgent Care?
The UCC is a busy care area. When you are in the main clinical area, visiting is limited to one person. For their own health and wellness, we discourage children under the age of 11 year old in the UCC area.
Will I automatically be admitted to the hospital?
No, the staff will:
 Review your hospital record.
 Take a brief medical history.
 Do a physical exam.
 Do tests based on your symptoms.
They will then decide if you can go home or if you need to come into the hospital.
Will my primary doctor(s) at MSKCC be aware of my visit to the UCC?
Yes. Once all of the results are done, the Urgent Care doctor will be in contact with your doctor(s). If your doctor is not available, he or she will call the doctor covering for the service. They will discuss your care. Your primary doctor may or may not see you in the Urgent Care Center.
What happens when I am discharged?
You will be given a list of any instructions you must follow. You will also get information booklets or fact cards if needed. The Urgent Care doctor or nurse will review your medicines with you if any are ordered. We will also give you important phone numbers and write them on your discharge sheet.
Do I need to notify my insurance company when I visit the Urgent Care Center?
Most insurance companies require that you let them know within 24-48 hours. If you do not do this, you may have to pay a higher co-payment or the total charge. The number to call is usually on your insurance card. If you have any questions, call Patient Financial Services at (212) 639-8242.
