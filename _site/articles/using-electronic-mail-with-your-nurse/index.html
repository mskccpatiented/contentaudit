<p>Electronic mail (e-mail) is a good way to communicate with your nurse. You can use e-mail to ask your nurse about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Medicine and refills.</li>
<li>Nutrition.</li>
<li>Your treatment plan.</li>
<li>Your test results.</li>
<li>Getting more information.</li>
</ul>


<p>However, you should be careful when sending e-mail. Use caution to ensure your safety and privacy.  This card has some basic information you should know about using e-mail. It also has guidelines you must follow to contact your nurse this way.  Please ask your nurse if you have any questions.</p>

<p>There are some situations when you should not use e-mail to communicate with your nurse. You should NOT send an e-mail:</p>

<ul>
<li>To tell your nurse about symptoms or urgent matters.</li>
<li>For matters that require a response the same day.  An example would be a prescription that needs a refill that day. It may take your nurse two business days to respond.</li>
<li>To tell your nurse about complicated issues.</li>
<li>To tell your nurse about highly private matters.
Instead, you should call your nurse or doctor to discuss any of these issues.</li>
</ul>


<h3>General Concerns</h3>

<ul>
<li>Privacy and security concerns about sending e-mail include:</li>
<li>The chance that an e-mail could be sent to a wrong address by mistake.</li>
<li>The chance that a third party could intercept a message between you and your nurse.</li>
<li>The fact that your employer can legally access e-mails that you send from a work account.</li>
<li>There is always the chance that your e-mail will not be received because of a technical problem.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Guidelines For Sending An E-Mail</h3>

<ol>
<li>Type your full name, date of birth, and the purpose of your message in the subject box (field) of your e-mail.  For example: John Smith 4/27/76 lab results.</li>
<li><p>When requesting a prescription refill, be sure to include:</p></li>
<li><p>The name and phone number of your pharmacy.</p></li>
<li>The name of your medicine.</li>
<li>The dosage.</li>
<li>How often you take it.</li>
<li><p>When you need the refill.</p></li>
<li><p>Your nurse will send you e-mail as a secure document.  This means that you will need to click on a link or copy the link and paste it on your internet browser to get the message.</p></li>
<li>If you do not get a response within two business days, call your nurse or doctor on the phone.</li>
<li><p>Your nurse may share your e-mail with other staff in order to answer your questions. He or she may consult with:</p></li>
<li><p>A doctor.</p></li>
<li>Another nurse.</li>
<li>A dietitian.</li>
<li>A pharmacist.</li>
<li><p>Office staff.</p></li>
<li><p>E-mails will become part of your medical record.  This means things that are communicated via e-mail are also noted in your files.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Using MyMSKCC</h3>

<p>Instead of emailing your nurse, you can also use MyMSKCC.<br/>
MyMSKCC (https://my.mskcc.org) is a private, personalized online link to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. You can use it to get information about your care and communicate with your doctors office. To enroll in MyMSKCC, please contact:</p>

<ul>
<li>A session assistant in clinic.</li>
<li>Your physicians office.</li>
<li>The MyMSKCC Help Desk at mymskcc@mskcc.org or 646-227-2593.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Our goal is to respond to your questions or requests in a quick and helpful way.  Your nurses e-mail address is private. You should not share it with others unless your nurse approves. The above guidelines are to help ensure your safety and the correct response to your e-mail.  If the guidelines are not met, your nurse may ask that you communicate over the phone instead.  If you need to talk to your doctor or nurse about something important you should call rather than send an e-mail.</p>
