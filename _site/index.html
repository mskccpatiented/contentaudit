<div class="content">
<p>A project is underway to improve patient education content provided to bone marrow transplant patients, as well as improving the way in which that content is delivered.</p></p>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>

<p>As part of the project, a <strong>content audit</strong> has been carried out; each piece of content relevant to BMT has been identified and categorized. Each piece of content has been converted from its current format (Word, PDF etc.) into a text file, then into a HTML web page.</p>

<div class="download"><a href="/bmt_contentaudit_pm2.xls"><span class="download-link"><div class="text">You can download the results of the content audit listing BMT-related patient education materials here. Download the audit, then use Excel to open the file.</div></span></a></div>


<p>The content audit has been used to inform a <strong>content strategy</strong>. Each piece of content has been summarized and a number of actions have been recommended e.g. that the content should be retained in its current format, re-written, augmented with new graphics, converted into audio or video.</p>

<p>As part of the content strategy each piece of content has been analyzed using a computer program to compare the language used in it to standard English - producing a list of infrequently-used words, jargon.</p>

<div class="download"><a href="/guidelines/bmt_glossary.xls"><span class="download-link"><div class="text">We have used the results of this analysis to update a glossary of BMT-related terms. This glossary can be included in BMT-related publications. Download the glossary, then use Excel to open the file.</div></span></a></div>


<p>Building on the content audit and strategy, <a href="/guidelines">a set of guidelines</a> to help Patient Education create new content for patients has been developed.</p>

<div class="download"><a href="/guidelines/bmt_content_decisions.xls"><span class="download-link"><div class="text">We've developed a tool to help you make good decisions about what type of content (text, graphics, audio, video) to use in different circumstances. Download the tool, then use Excel to open the file.</div></span></a></div>
