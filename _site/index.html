<div class="content">
<p>A project is underway to improve patient education content provided to bone marrow transplant patients, as well as improving the way in which that content is delivered.</p></p>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>

<p>As part of the project, a <strong>content audit</strong> has been carried out; each piece of content relevant to BMT has been identified and categorized. Each piece of content has been converted from its current format (Word, PDF etc.) into a text file, then into a HTML web page.</p>

<p>The content audit has been used to inform a <strong>content strategy</strong>. Each piece of content has been summarized and a number of actions have been recommended e.g. that the content should be retained in its current format, re-written, augmented with new graphics, converted into audio or video.</p>

<p>As part of the content strategy each piece of content has been analyzed using a computer program to compare the language used in it to standard English - producing a list of infrequently-used words, jargon. This is the beginning of an automated approach to producing a <strong>glossary</strong> for each piece of content.</p>

<h3>This Site</h3>

<p>The results of this work have been published on this site. You'll find <a href="/articles">each BMT-related piece of content</a> (referred to as "articles") recommended actions and other useful meta-data; the beginnings of an online resource for BMT. Please note that the articles contain no graphics at this point in time.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>All feedback, comments and questions should be addressed to <a href="mailto:mayp@mskcc.org">Paul May</a>.</p>
