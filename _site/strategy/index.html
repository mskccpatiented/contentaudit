<div class="content_wide">
<p>This content strategy makes makes a number of recommendations about how content should be produced and maintained in the future.</p>

<h3>Content Production - Recommended Actions</h3>

<p>Each piece of BMT-related content (referred to as an "article" for consistency) has been analyzed; approximately 98 articles. For each article, one or more of <strong>six actions</strong> have been made:</p>

<p><strong>Re-Think</strong>: Some articles are in need of a broad re-think. For example, some articles might be presented better if they were divided into smaller articles.</p>

<p><strong>Re-Write</strong>: These articles would require additional writing or re-writing before they could be presented in other formats (e.g. online)</p>

<p><strong>Improve Graphics</strong>: These articles could be augmented with new graphics or diagrams/illustrations.</p>

<p><strong>Improve Photography</strong>: These articles could be augmented with photographs of real-world objects or situations.</p>

<p><strong>Record Audio/Podcast</strong>: These articles cover topics that would work well if they were recorded as audio and/or published as a podcast.</p>

<p><strong>Record Video</strong>: These articles cover topics that would work well if they were produced as videos.</p>

<p>The recommended actions associated with each article are <a href="/articles">listed</a> on this site.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="/articles/skin-care-guidelines-for-patients-receiving-radiation-therapy/">this article on skin care</a> is not in need of a comprehensive re-think, but should be re-written in more fluid text. It would also work well as a piece of audio - perhaps a recorded conversation with a dermatologist who could offer advice to patients undergoing radiotherapy.</p>

<p>The spread of all recommended actions is shown below:</p>

<h3>General Recommendations - Content</h3>

<h4>Maintenance</h4>

<h4>Publishing</h4>

<p>At the moment Patient Education content is published as printed documents and online through the patient portal as PDFs. It may now be desirable to consider other publishing platforms to deliver content.</p>

<p>For example; audio recordings could be published online and submitted to iTunes as a podcast. This would allow patients to download brief, informative pieces of content related to their care from their personal devices.</p>

<p>A similar approach could be used for video; using a Vimeo or YouTube channel to deliver useful content. Twitter could even be used to publish small tips related to BMT, which could link back to longer, more substantive articles.</p>

<h4>External Links</h4>

<h4>Hypertext</h4>

<p>At the moment, content is produced as a set of standalone, printed articles. Despite the fact that these articles cover compatible topics there is little cross-referencing done.</p>

<p>It may be think in terms of "subject areas" and sets of related articles. For example, rather than publishing a single article as a guide for caregivers, a number of related articles useful to caregivers could be produced and <em>cross-referenced</em> with one another.</p>

<h4>Writing Style</h4>

<p>At the moment, patient education content is written for printed publication. When this content is presented in other formats (e.g. online) it can be long and difficult to follow - especially when bullet-points are used in place of full sentences.</p>

<p>It may be beneficial to re-write some content to make it more <em>succinct and fluid</em>.</p>

<h4>Language</h4>

<p>At the moment a significant amount of necessarily technical language is included in Patient Education content.</p>

<p>It would be useful to produce <em>a glossary</em> of technical words, medical terms that could be presented to readers.</p>

<h3>General Recommendations - Workflow</h3>

<h4>Content Management, Version Control</h4>

<p>At the moment, Patient Education content is stored as a set of Word and PDF articles on a shared drive. Separately, a SharePoint database is used to keep track of important metadata about each article.</p>

<p>It may be desirable to move to a system that could store the content itself, as well as metadata about that content. This system could also record changes made to a article over time - giving a complete trail of versions from the time a article is created through publication and maintenance.</p>

<h4>Single Source, Multiple Output Formats</h4>

<p>Patient Education content is currently stored as Word articles and then re-formatted for print and online publication.</p>

<p>It may be desirable to have a system where a single version each piece of content (e.g. a version stored in a content management system) could be used to produce a number of different formats; printed articles, web pages, e-books etc.</p>

<h4>Collaboration</h4>

<p>Patient Education produce and update content by editing individual Word files, using e-mail and Word's track changes feature to decide how articles should change over time.</p>

<p>It may be desirable to move to a system that allows authors to work in a more fluid manner - editing through a web browser, annotating and commenting upon content, and having that dialogue saved as metadata associated with each article.</p>
