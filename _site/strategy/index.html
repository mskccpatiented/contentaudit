<h3>Background</h3>

<p>MSKCC's Patient Education Department produces a range of information and educational materials that are offered to patients by members of their healthcare team during their treatment.</p>

<p>Patient Education's approach to its work is changing in light of a number of factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>An increasing focus on the provision of patient-centered care that "encompasses qualities of compassion, empathy, and responsiveness to the needs, values, and expressed preferences of the individual patient" (<a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/qual/nhqr11/chap5.htm#iom2001a">Institute of Medicine</a>, 2001)</li>
<li>An need to reflect this patient-centered approach in the provision of information and educational resources while also being mindful of patients' culture, race, physical ability, preferred language and other factors.</li>
<li>The significant changes in the way that information is created, stored, accessed, understood, shared, commented-upon, edited and lived that have been brought about by mass-adoption of networked computers, the world wide web and other technologies. (<a href="http://pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/Trend-Data-(Adults)/Device-Ownership.aspx">Pew Internet Research Center</a>, 2012)</li>
</ul>


<p>New approaches need to be developed that allow MSKCC to understand patients' unique circumstances, needs and preferences and respond appropriately. Practically this could mean:</p>

<ul>
<li>Asking patients to complete a questionnaire about their background and learning preferences</li>
<li>Producing educational content in many languages, using a range of different media and to different levels of detail</li>
<li>Storing educational content as digital assets so that they can be offered/integrated in many different ways</li>
<li>Creating a unique information "prescription" for each patient</li>
<li>Helping patients to answer their own questions by recommending other (i.e. non-MSKCC) reliable sources</li>
<li>Continually improving materials, workflows and tools so that the changing needs of patients can be met</li>
</ul>


<h3>Previous Projects</h3>

<p>The Adult BMT Service at MSKCC has supported a number of projects by the Patient Education Department and the Strategic Planning and Innovation Department. These projects have investigated topics related to patients' experience of their treatment at MSKCC, including their experience of education and information.</p>

<p>A recent project dealt specifically with the way that BMT patients access information and learn about their treatment. During this project it was found that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Patients can feel overwhelmed by the volume of information they encounter before, during and after their treatment</li>
<li>Patients undergoing the same treatment can have significantly different learning styles and preferences</li>
<li>Patients use information as a way of understanding, but also as a way of supporting practical, day to day actions</li>
<li>Patient primary source of trusted information is their healthcare team</li>
</ol>


<h2>This Project</h2>

<p>This project builds upon the work done in previous projects and focuses on the outpatient autologous BMT population. The goals of this project are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify what content relevant to this population has been produced by MSKCC (a content audit)</li>
<li>Develop an approach to developing this content further or creating content that doesn't already exist (a content strategy)</li>
<li>Draft/create content</li>
</ul>


<h3>Content Audit</h3>

<p>As a first step all content produced by the Patient Education Department was collated. (Each piece of content is referred to as an "article" for consistency, though they range from single-page fact cards to diagrams, templates and longer guides). Most of the articles were written and designed to be printed as "fact cards" or longer guides.</p>

<p>Each piece of content relevant to Bone Marrow Transplantation was identified and analyzed; 98 articles in all.</p>

<p>Each article was then described, categorized and summarized. This data is available in the Content Audit spreadsheet and a sample is shown below.</p>

<table>
<tr><th class="twenty">Article Title</th><th class="twenty">Type</th><th class="twenty">Category</th><th class="forty">Summary</th></tr>

<tr>
<td class="twenty">Neutropenia</td>
<td class="twenty">Fact Card - 2 pages - Text</td>
<td class="twenty">Side Effects and Symptom Management</td>
<td class="forty">What is a white blood cell, what is neutropenia, how to avoid infections, personal care, washing, hygiene, what not to eat, symptoms to watch out for. Who to contact if you have issues.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="twenty">Low Microbial Diet</td>
<td class="twenty">Longer Guide - 9 pages - Text</td>
<td class="twenty">Side Effects and Symptom Management</td>
<td class="forty">Why a LM diet is valuable, how it helps reduce the risk of food-borne diseases or microbes that could cause illness in people who are immune-suppressed. What is a microbe. What to buy. How to store food. How to keep the kitchen clean and safe preparation and handling. What foods to eat and what to avoid.</td>
</tr>

</table>


<p>As well as an audit of existing content, a list of patients' frequently asked questions (created in an earlier project) was checked to see what questions can be answered using existing articles. This data is included in the content audit spreadsheet.</p>

<h4>From Print to Digital</h4>

<p>At the moment Patient Education content is produced with print in mind. A key output of this project is a strategy that lists content that could be improved or re-developed for publication online and in other digital formats.</p>

<p>Writing clearly and succinctly for the web can be challenging. It is usually not possible to take content written for print and transfer it directly to a digital format without editing. Digital publishing also allows for hyperlinking, the addition of graphics, audio, video, animation - richer content.</p>

<p>Because of this, a second step of the content audit involved converting all BMT-related articles from Word or PDF format to HTML and <a href="/articles">publishing them online</a>.</p>

<p>It's now possible to see, almost at a glance, what articles work online, what ones could be improved, and what ones need to be re-imagined in some way.</p>

<h4>Analysis for Obscure/Technical Language</h4>

<p>A computer application was written that compared each word in the articles to a corpus of standard written English. The application produced a list of words for each article that would not ordinarily appear in written English including many technical and medical terms that may need to be explained to patients.</p>

<p>The list of obscure words is included at the top of each article and could form the basis for a glossary of terms related to BMT.</p>

<h3>Content Strategy</h3>

</div>


<h4>Recommended Actions</h4>

<p>For each article, one or more of <strong>six actions</strong> have been made:</p>

<p><strong>Re-Think</strong>: Some articles are in need of a broad re-think. For example, some articles might be presented better if they were divided into smaller articles.</p>

<p><strong>Re-Write</strong>: These articles would require additional writing or re-writing before they could be presented in other formats (e.g. online)</p>

<p><strong>Improve Graphics</strong>: These articles could be augmented with new graphics or diagrams/illustrations.</p>

<p><strong>Improve Photography</strong>: These articles could be augmented with photographs of real-world objects or situations.</p>

<p><strong>Record Audio/Podcast</strong>: These articles cover topics that would work well if they were recorded as audio and/or published as a podcast.</p>

<p><strong>Record Video</strong>: These articles cover topics that would work well if they were produced as videos.</p>

<p>The recommended actions associated with each article are <a href="/articles">listed</a> on this site.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="/articles/skin-care-guidelines-for-patients-receiving-radiation-therapy/">this article on skin care</a> is not in need of a comprehensive re-think, but should be re-written in more fluid text. It would also work well as a piece of audio - perhaps a recorded conversation with a dermatologist who could offer advice to patients undergoing radiotherapy.</p>

<p>The spread of all recommended actions is shown below:</p>

<table>
<tr><th class="fifty">Action</th><th>Num. Articles</th></tr>
<tr><td class="fifty">Re-Think</td><td>20</td></tr>
<tr><td class="fifty">Full/Partial Re-write</td><td>44</td></tr>
<tr><td class="fifty">Improve Graphics</td><td>28</td></tr>
<tr><td class="fifty">Improve Photography</td><td>35</td></tr>
<tr><td class="fifty">Record Audio/Podcast<td>55</td></tr>
<tr><td class="fifty">Record Video</td><td>19</td></tr>

<h3>General Recommendations - Content</h3>

<h4>Publishing</h4>

<p>At the moment Patient Education content is published as printed documents and online through the patient portal as PDFs. It may now be desirable to consider other publishing platforms to deliver content.</p>

<p>For example; audio recordings could be published online and submitted to iTunes as a podcast. This would allow patients to download brief, informative pieces of content related to their care from their personal devices.</p>

<p>A similar approach could be used for video; using a Vimeo or YouTube channel to deliver useful content. Twitter could even be used to publish small tips related to BMT, which could link back to longer, more substantive articles.</p>

<h4>Hypertext</h4>

<p>At the moment, content is produced as a set of standalone, printed articles. Despite the fact that these articles cover compatible topics there is little cross-referencing done.</p>

<p>It may be think in terms of "subject areas" and sets of related articles. For example, rather than publishing a single article as a guide for caregivers, a number of related articles useful to caregivers could be produced and <em>cross-referenced</em> with one another.</p>

<h4>Writing Style</h4>

<p>At the moment, patient education content is written for printed publication. When this content is presented in other formats (e.g. online) it can be long and difficult to follow - especially when bullet-points are used in place of full sentences.</p>

<p>It may be beneficial to re-write some content to make it more <em>succinct and fluid</em>.</p>

<h4>Language</h4>

<p>At the moment a significant amount of necessarily technical language is included in Patient Education content.</p>

<p>It would be useful to produce <em>a glossary</em> of technical words, medical terms that could be presented to readers.</p>

<h3>General Recommendations - Workflow</h3>

<h4>Content Management, Version Control</h4>

<p>At the moment, Patient Education content is stored as a set of Word and PDF articles on a shared drive. Separately, a SharePoint database is used to keep track of important metadata about each article.</p>

<p>It may be desirable to move to a system that could store the content itself, as well as metadata about that content. This system could also record changes made to a article over time - giving a complete trail of versions from the time a article is created through publication and maintenance.</p>

<h4>Single Source, Multiple Output Formats</h4>

<p>Patient Education content is currently stored as Word articles and then re-formatted for print and online publication.</p>

<p>It may be desirable to have a system where a single version each piece of content (e.g. a version stored in a content management system) could be used to produce a number of different formats; printed articles, web pages, e-books etc.</p>

<h4>Collaboration</h4>

<p>Patient Education produce and update content by editing individual Word files, using e-mail and Word's track changes feature to decide how articles should change over time.</p>

<p>It may be desirable to move to a system that allows authors to work in a more fluid manner - editing through a web browser, annotating and commenting upon content, and having that dialogue saved as metadata associated with each article.</p>
