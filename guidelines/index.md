## When to Use Text, Audio, Video, Photography
In the past the production of high quality audio, video and photography was expensive and required specialized skills and equipment.  

The broad availability of powerful computers, digital cameras, recording devices, internet access and user-friendly software means that audio, video and photography can be produced, published and consumed at relatively low cost. It's now possible for content producers to consider using these types of media when trying to inform, educate, coach and inspire people to action. 

The availability of these different types of media makes it more important than ever to make good decisions about what media to use and when. We have so many options open to us, we need to choose the right ones.

## Starting Point - Audience, Goal, Approach
As a starting point, let's decide that our primary audience is current MSKCC patients, their caregivers and families. Other people might consume the media that we produce, but they are not our primary audience. 

Let's also decide that our explicit goal is to improve these patients' ability to participate in their care (i.e. understand what is happening and why it is happening and be able to explain those things to other people) and support their to ability to make decisions (i.e. use what they know to choose one course of action over another while understanding the positives/negatives that apply to both). 

Tangentially, let's quietly decide that while we are not setting out to explicitly to enhance the reputation of the hospital this might happen as a byproduct of making good content (i.e. we are not marketing to our primary audience, though they may feel a stronger affinity to us because we inform them in a competent manner).

Our purpose in life is to meet this our explicit goal for our primary audience by facilitating learning experiences, supported by relevant content. 

We want to apply our resources sensibly to meet our goal. Whenever we need to communicate something it helps us to know what medium will serve us best. Producing a comprehensive booklet about the causes of a particular disease is probably not going to represent good value for money if a lot of good information has already been published elsewhere - and patients may not want to read it anyway. 

Writing intricate sets of instructions that help patients carry out a task is probably going to take far longer than shooting and narrating a video of the task being carried out using an iPhone, and writing some supporting text. 

Actively considering what medium to use saves time, money and improves the learning experience for our audience. 

## Text
Text is our default, our go-to, our bread and butter medium. In practically all cases we will write *something* when we want to help patients learn. We will write text for them to read and learn from, or we will produce content that supports an experience they have elsewhere - serving as a reference aid (e.g. a document that recaps on a session with a therapist, or  written instructions to a demonstrated task).

### The Benefits of Using Text
**Just the Facts**: Unlike speech, we can communicate using text in a way that is highly structured. If we understand what we want to say and why, we can pare our text down to the bare essentials. This allows our text to appear simple while still communicating meaning.

**We Have the Tools**: Producing text requires few special tools and is a well understood process. We are taught how to write at an early age, are surrounded by text-production tools - from the ballpoint pen to the word processing package on our computer. Most people, if asked to produce a piece of text, could do so. This is not the case for other media like audio or video.

**Simple Formats**: Publishing text is straightforward. We can hard write text and hand it to people, print it onto paper many times, or upload it to the web where it can be read from a computer screen. We have a good understanding of the technologies that make text available to anybody who wants to read it.

**Low Barrier**: Once we have published text most of the work is already done. The person coming to the text needs to understand how to read in a particular language, but needs little other technology (eyeglasses being the exception).

**Skimmability**: Because there's such a low barrier to consumption, and because text is traditionally laid out in sections/pages we can **skim** to the most interesting passages, and restart reading quickly if we are interrupted. These seemingly trivial tasks are less straightforward in all other media.

**Interoperability**: Text is flexible enough to allow one piece of text to refer to another piece of text. Half way through a document, we can reference another source using an annotation<span class="superscript noblock">1</span> or a <a href="#">hyperlink</a>.


### The Downside to Text
**If I Had More Time I'd Write You a Shorter Letter**: Writing succinctly takes considerable practice.

**Imagination Required**: When we describe things in text we are prompting the reader to imagine those things. This can be wonderful if we're writing poetry, but isn't a great way to communicate with precision. Describing a medical device completely in text and then and asking the patient to imagine themselves using that device is unlikely to be precise enough for our purposes (in the same way that maps exist because having written directions to every place, from every place, would be annoying).

**Cognitive Load**: While the evidence related to the amount of work that reading imposes on our minds is patchy, anecdotally is seems as though reading imposes a relatively high cognitive load. Reading requires concentration, and it is difficult to do when we are tired, stressed or surrounded by distractions (particularly if we are surrounded by other people talking).

**Hands-On**: Reading text usually requires for the reader to have one or both hands free so that they can hold a book, a page or an e-reader. If it's likely that the person we're communicating with won't have their hands free then text may not be the best medium to use.

**Ubiquity/Lack of Novelty**: It is probably worth noting that because written text is seemingly ubiquitous its perceived value might be diminished. Our document that describes the side effects of Drug X might contain incredibly useful information, but if it is one of dozens and dozens of other, similar documents on related subjects it may be perceived as just another document about just another drug. If our goal is to get people to understand Drug X and its side effects then packaging that information in a way that appears to be special and novel may help us achieve our goal in more cases.

## Audio
Audio, or more specifically recorded speech, is an effective medium to use when we need to communicate information with personality and emphasis. 

### The Benefits of Using Audio
**Personal**: When we hear a recording of a person speaking, we are not actually hearing a person speaking. We just can't help but ascribe the things we associate with people to recorded audio - personality, emotion, warmth. We can take advantage of the personality of recorded speech when we need to communicate information. 

**The Stand-In**: Using audio allows us to record conversations between people with one or more of the participants in that conversation standing in for the listener.

For example, we could record a knowledgeable doctor speaking to an interested, but less well-informed person. The less well-informed person is a stand-in for the listener. He asks the types of questions that the listener wants to ask and clarifies points if they don't make sense or need to be emphasized. 

**Easy to Produce**: Recording and producing good quality audio can be relatively straightforward and need not be expensive. You can record on a laptop, a cell phone, an audio recorder, or in a recording studio - depending on your needs. 

When recording a conversation, staring with a well-prepared script or structure, then recording in a quiet room using the right microphone will mitigate a lot of problems that would otherwise need to be fixed in post-production.

**Hands Free**: Listening to audio doesn't require the listener to have free hands. This means that a person can carry out tasks (driving, following instructions) while listening to audio. 

### The Downsides to Audio
**Subjects**: Producing audio means finding people who are willing to speak while being recorded and who can communicate with clarity and personality. 

**Imagination Required**: One of the key strengths of audio is that it encourages the listener to imagine people and places without pictures. This is good in that it focuses the listener's attention on information, rather than the color of the subject's shirt. But, this also means that the interview subject or guide/presenter has to do a good job of describing people, objects and places. In some cases it may be a good idea to support audio with physical objects of visual aids.

**Logistics**: Recording good quality audio requires planning and preparation - identifying topics, scheduling time with subjects, developing scripts, finding a recording location, making technical arrangements etc.
