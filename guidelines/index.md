## When to Use Text, Audio, Video, Photography
In the past, the production of high quality audio, video and photography was expensive and required specialized skills and equipment.  

The broad availability of powerful computers, digital cameras, recording devices, internet access and user-friendly software means that audio, video and photography can be produced, published and consumed at relatively low cost. It's now possible for content producers to consider using these types of media when trying to inform, educate, coach and inspire people.

The availability of these different types of media makes it more important than ever to make good decisions about what media to use and when. We have so many options open to us, we need to choose the right ones.

## Starting Point - Audience
When considering what type of content to create, first you need to be clear about who you are serving - your primary audience. Who are you trying to speak to? What do you know about these people? 

In our case, let's decide that our primary audience is current MSKCC patients, their caregivers and families.

Once you have named your audience. Try to put yourself in your audience's shoes and ask why they need content. 

We know that patients and their caregivers need to participate in their care (i.e. understand what is happening and why it is happening and be able to explain those things to other people) and make informed decisions (i.e. use what they know to choose one course of action over another while understanding the positives/negatives that apply to both). 

Now we are making progress. We know that the content we create has to help current MSKCC patients, their caregivers and families participate in their care and make informed decisions.

Now we can zoom in a little. What content will meet these needs? When does our audience want this content? What is the best way to get that content to them? It's likely that we'll now identify a smaller group of patients and caregivers, find out more about who they are, and learn about the things they need. 

Let's imagine that we are creating content for autologous stem cell transplant patients, their caregivers and their families. By speaking to patients, and observing them as they go on their journey with us, we find out that they want to understand their underlying diagnosis - the reason they need a transplant. They want to understand why this particular type of transplant is being recommended. They need to make decisions that effect them in the long-term, such as decisions about their fertility. 

We also find out that caregivers need to know how to support the patient practically and emotionally. They will manage medications, maintain schedules, drive the patient to and from the hospital, take the patients temperature, etc. 

We work with the healthcare team to understand the types of things that patients need to know, such as the risks and side effects associated with the transplant. 

## Approach
Now that we have set out who we are speaking to, and we understand what their basic needs are, we can start to decide:

* What content will meet those needs?
* How we will make or acquire that content?
* How we will make that content available?
* How we will improve that content over time?

These decisions make up our *approach*, out little plan of action to meet the needs of our audience. We might make a table to map out our approach

<table>
<tr><th>Need</th><th>Content Offered</th><th>Content Source</th><th>Delivery</th><th>Improvement</th></tr>
 
<tr><td>Patient needs to understand effect of chemotherapy on fertility.</td><td>Booklet about the effects of chemotherapy on fertility.</td><td>Existing content made in-house, updated to reflect SCT-specific issues.</td><td>Made available in print and online through the patient portal.</td><td>Reviewed annually by NP specializing in fertility issues.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Caregiver needs to know how to apply waterproof cover to catheter before the patient takes a shower.</td><td>Video showing how waterproof cover is applied. Supported by written, step by step instructions.</td><td>New content to be created from scratch.</td><td>Made available online through the patient portal. Printed instructions available on request.</td><td>Reviewed annually by NP.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Patient and caregiver need to know why this type of transplant is being recommended.</td><td>Video or audio of their doctor explaining this type of transplant.</td><td>New content to be created from scratch.</td><td>Made available online through the patient portal and via iTunes.</td><td>Reviewed annually by Patient Education.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Patient and caregiver want data/statistics about the success of this type of transplant.</td><td>Publications that show the results of trials of this type of transplant.</td><td>Link to Google Scholar or Pubmed.</td><td>Linked to from the patient portal.</td><td>Reviewed as new evidence becomes available.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Patient and caregiver need to understand how the chemotherapy drug works and its side effects.</td><td>Written description of the drug's actions and side effects.</td><td>Bought in from external provider of drug information. Link to or cite trusted sources of information that describe side effects.</td><td>Made available online through the patient portal. Printed versions available on request.</td><td>Reviewed biennially by Patient Education.</td></tr>

</table>

Let's break those choices down in a little more detail.

### Content Offered
For each piece of content we acquire, link to, or create, we should understand: 

* The need it meets in our audience
* The specific things we need the audience to learn by engaging with the content 

### Content Source
Sometimes it makes sense for us to make new content to meet the needs of patients and caregivers, but sometimes we could choose a different approach:

* We could cite or link to content we find elsewhere. 
* We could start with content from elsewhere, and re-work it to meet our specific needs. 
* We could take a piece of content made elsewhere, duplicate it, then provide it to our audience.

In choosing our approach, we can ask ourselves a number of questions to help make good decisions:

* Does this content already exist in-house and is it up to date?
* If the content is not up to date, what will it take to bring it up to date?
* Should the content be delivered in its current format, or would it meet patients' needs in a different format?
* Do we have the skills, tools and people to make or update the content ourselves?
* Do we have the financial resources to make or update the content ourselves

If we decide that we don't have existing content to meet patients' needs, or don't have the resources to create content ourselves, maybe we will try to find content from elsewhere. It's likely we'll ask questions like:  

* Does the content exist elsewhere?
* Do we trust the source of the content?
* Can we use this content?
* Is the patient's experience going to be harmed if we use content from outside MSKCC?  
* What new opportunities arise if we use content from outside MSKCC?
* What are the risks of using content from outside MSKCC?

### Delivery




## Text
Text is our default, our go-to, our bread and butter medium. In practically all cases we will write *something* when we want to help patients learn. We will write text for them to read and learn from, or we will produce content that supports an experience they have elsewhere - serving as a reference aid (e.g. a document that recaps on a session with a therapist, or  written instructions to a demonstrated task).

### The Benefits of Using Text
**Just the Facts**: Unlike speech, we can communicate using text in a way that is highly structured. If we understand what we want to say and why, we can pare our text down to the bare essentials. This allows our text to appear simple while still communicating meaning.

**We Have the Tools**: Producing text requires few special tools and is a well understood process. We are taught how to write at an early age, are surrounded by text-production tools - from the ballpoint pen to the word processing package on our computer. Most people, if asked to produce a piece of text, could do so. This is not the case for other media like audio or video.

**Simple Formats**: Publishing text is straightforward. We can hard write text and hand it to people, print it onto paper many times, or upload it to the web where it can be read from a computer screen. We have a good understanding of the technologies that make text available to anybody who wants to read it.

**Low Barrier**: Once we have published text most of the work is already done. The person coming to the text needs to understand how to read in a particular language, but needs little other technology (eyeglasses being the exception).

**Skimmability**: Because there's such a low barrier to consumption, and because text is traditionally laid out in sections/pages we can **skim** to the most interesting passages, and restart reading quickly if we are interrupted. These seemingly trivial tasks are less straightforward in all other media.

**Interoperability**: Text is flexible enough to allow one piece of text to refer to another piece of text. Half way through a document, we can reference another source using an annotation<span class="superscript noblock">1</span> or a <a href="#">hyperlink</a>.


### The Downside to Text
**If I Had More Time I'd Write You a Shorter Letter**: Writing succinctly takes considerable practice.

**Imagination Required**: When we describe things in text we are prompting the reader to imagine those things. This can be wonderful if we're writing poetry, but isn't a great way to communicate with precision. Describing a medical device completely in text and then and asking the patient to imagine themselves using that device is unlikely to be precise enough for our purposes (in the same way that maps exist because having written directions to every place, from every place, would be annoying).

**Cognitive Load**: While the evidence related to the amount of work that reading imposes on our minds is patchy, anecdotally is seems as though reading imposes a relatively high cognitive load. Reading requires concentration, and it is difficult to do when we are tired, stressed or surrounded by distractions (particularly if we are surrounded by other people talking).

**Hands-On**: Reading text usually requires for the reader to have one or both hands free so that they can hold a book, a page or an e-reader. If it's likely that the person we're communicating with won't have their hands free then text may not be the best medium to use.

**Ubiquity/Lack of Novelty**: Because written text is ubiquitous its perceived value can be diminished. Our document that describes the side effects of Drug X might contain incredibly useful information, but if it is one of dozens and dozens of other, similar documents I might not read it. If our goal is to get people to understand Drug X and its side effects then packaging that information in a way that appears to be special and novel may help us achieve our goal in more cases.

## Audio
Audio, or more specifically recorded speech, is an effective medium to use when we need to communicate information with personality and emphasis.

### The Benefits of Using Audio
**Personal**: When we hear a recording of a person speaking, we are not actually hearing a person speaking, but it *feels* as though we are.

**The Stand-In**: Using audio allows us to record conversations between people with one or more of the participants in that conversation standing in for the listener.

For example, we could record a knowledgeable doctor speaking to an interested, but less well-informed person. The less well-informed person is a stand-in for the listener. He asks the types of questions that the listener wants to ask and clarifies points if they don't make sense or need to be emphasized. 

**Easy to Produce**: Recording and producing good quality audio can be relatively straightforward and need not be expensive. You can record on a laptop, a cell phone, an audio recorder, or in a recording studio - depending on your needs. 

When recording a conversation, staring with a well-prepared script or structure, then recording in a quiet room using the right microphone will mitigate a lot of problems that would otherwise need to be fixed in post-production.

**Hands Free**: Listening to audio doesn't require the listener to have free hands. This means that a person can carry out tasks (driving, following instructions) while listening to audio. 

### The Downsides to Audio
**Subjects**: Producing audio means finding people who are willing to speak while being recorded and who can communicate with clarity and personality. 

**Imagination Required**: One of the key strengths of audio is that it encourages the listener to imagine people and places without pictures. This is good in that it focuses the listener's attention on information, rather than the color of the subject's shirt. But, this also means that the interview subject or guide/presenter has to do a good job of describing people, objects and places. In some cases it may be a good idea to support audio with physical objects of visual aids.

**Logistics**: Recording good quality audio requires planning and preparation - identifying topics, scheduling time with subjects, developing scripts, finding a recording location, making technical arrangements etc.
