In the past, the production of high quality audio, video and photography was expensive and required specialized skills and equipment.  

The broad availability of powerful computers, digital cameras, recording devices, internet access and user-friendly software means that audio, video and photography can be produced, published and consumed at relatively low cost. 

The availability of these different types of media makes it more important than ever to make good decisions about what media to use and when. 

## Starting Point - Audience
When considering what type of content to create, first you need to be clear about who you are serving - your primary audience. Who are you trying to speak to? What do you know about these people? 

In our case, let's decide that our primary audience is current MSKCC patients, their caregivers and families.

Once you have named your audience. Try to put yourself in your audience's shoes and ask why they need content. 

We know from working directly with patients and caregiver that they need to participate in their care (i.e. understand what is happening and why it is happening and be able to explain those things to other people) and make informed decisions (i.e. use what they know to choose one course of action over another while understanding the positives/negatives that apply to both). 

Now we can zoom in a little. We can ask some simple questions:

* What content will meet these needs? 
* When does our audience want this content? 
* What is the best way to get that content to them? 

From here, it's likely that we'll now refine our understanding of our primary audience - we'll name a smaller group of patients and caregivers, find out more about who they are, and learn about the things they need.

Let's imagine that we are creating content for autologous stem cell transplant patients, their caregivers and their families. 

By speaking to these patients, by observing them as they go on their journey with us, and by speaking to members of their healthcare team, we identify these needs:

* The need to understand their underlying diagnosis - the reason they need a transplant. 
* The need to understand why this particular type of transplant is being recommended. 
* The need to understand what will happen to them on their journey with us - tests, procedures, how they'll feel, etc. 
* The need to understand risks associated with their treatment, and side effects associated with the transplant.
* The need to make decisions that effect them in the long-term, such as decisions about their fertility. 

We also find out that caregivers need to know how to support the patient practically and emotionally. They will manage medications, maintain schedules, drive the patient to and from the hospital, take the patients temperature, etc. 

## Approach
Now that we have set out who we are speaking to, and we understand what their basic needs are, we can ask:

* What content will meet those needs?
* How we will make or acquire that content?
* How we will make that content available?
* How we will improve that content over time?

Our answers to these questions define our *approach*, our plan of action to meet the needs of our audience:

<table>
<tr><th>Need</th><th>Content Offered</th><th>Format & Delivery</th><th>Content Source</th><th>Improvement</th></tr>
 
<tr><td>Patient needs to understand effect of chemotherapy on fertility.</td><td>Short term risks associated with chemotherapy and sexual health. Information about chemotherapy-related infertility. Information about fertility preservation. List of resources.</td><td>Concise written guide offered in print and online. Audio of MSKCC fertility experts discussing the issues humanely offered through portal and iTunes. Map showing local fertility experts and clinics offer through portal. Links to up to date research and literature offered through portal. </td><td>Adapt existing materials. Create audio based on current guide. Create map using list of recommended fertility clinics. Work with healthcare team to identify external resources.</td><td>Written materials and audio reviewed every two years. List of local clinics and links to relevant resources updated on an ongoing basis.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Caregiver needs to know how to apply waterproof cover to catheter before the patient takes a shower.</td><td>Step by step instructions showing how waterproof cover is applied. Common problems faced when applying the cover. What to do if there are issues/in an emergency.</td><td>Video of a caregiver and a patient slowly and methodically applying the cover, offered through portal. Concise step by step instructions enhanced with photos/stills from video, made available online through the patient portal and in print.</td><td>New content to be created from scratch.</td><td>Reviewed biennially by Patient Education in consultation with nursing staff.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Patient and caregiver need to know why this type of transplant is being recommended.</td><td>Clear explanation that connects the diagnosis of multiple myeloma with autologous transplantation. Why AutoSCT is appropriate. Why AlloSCT is less appropriate. Overview of AutoSCT. Frequently asked questions.  </td><td>Concise written guide made available through the portal and in print. Video and audio of senior SCT doctor explaining AutoSCT and its value in treating myeloma, offered through patient portal and iTunes. Links to relevant studies/articles. Links to external resources. </td><td>New content to be created from scratch.</td><td>Written material, audio and video reviewed biennially by Patient Education. Links and resources updated on an ongoing basis. </td></tr>

<tr><td>Patient and caregiver want data/statistics about the success of this type of transplant.</td><td>Publications that show the results of trials of this type of transplant, linked to from the patient portal.</td><td>Link to Google Scholar or Pubmed.</td><td>Consult with SCT healthcare team to identify relevant resources, articles.</td><td>Review on an ongoing basis. Ask SCT team to forward relevant articles as they become aware of them. Consider using a shared bookmarking service to speed up this workflow.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Patient and caregiver need to understand how the chemotherapy drug works and its side effects.</td><td>Description of the drug's actions and side effects.</td><td>Concise written guide to each drug and its effects. Made available online through the patient portal. Printed versions available on request.</td><td>Bought in from external provider of drug information.</td><td>Reviewed biennially by Patient Education.</td></tr>

Let's look at some of  those choices in a little more detail.

### Content Source
Sometimes it makes sense for us to make new content to meet the needs of patients and caregivers, but sometimes we could choose a different approach:

* We could cite or link to content we find elsewhere. 
* We could start with content from elsewhere, and re-work it to meet our specific needs. 
* We could take a piece of content made elsewhere, duplicate it, then provide it to our audience.

In choosing our approach, we can ask ourselves a number of questions to help make good decisions:

* Does this content already exist in-house and is it up to date?
* If the content is not up to date, what will it take to bring it up to date?
* Should the content be delivered in its current format, or would it meet patients' needs in a different format?
* Do we have the skills, tools and people to make or update the content ourselves?
* Do we have the financial resources to make or update the content ourselves

If we decide that we don't have existing content to meet patients' needs, or don't have the resources to create content ourselves, maybe we will try to find content from elsewhere. It's likely we'll ask questions like:  

* Does the content exist elsewhere?
* Do we trust the source of the content?
* Can we use this content?
* Is the patient's experience going to be harmed if we use content from outside MSKCC?  
* What new opportunities arise if we use content from outside MSKCC?
* What are the risks of using content from outside MSKCC?

### Delivery & Format
Our goal is to apply our resources sensibly to meet patients' needs.

## Text
Text is our default, our go-to, our bread and butter medium. In practically all cases we will write *something* when we want to help patients learn. We will write text for them to read and learn from, or we will produce content that supports an experience they have elsewhere - serving as a reference aid (e.g. a document that recaps on a session with a therapist, or  written instructions to a demonstrated task).

### The Benefits of Using Text
**Just the Facts**: Unlike speech, we can communicate using text in a way that is highly structured. If we understand what we want to say and why, we can pare our text down to the bare essentials. This allows our text to appear simple while still communicating meaning.

**We Have the Tools**: Producing text requires few special tools and is a well understood process. We are taught how to write at an early age, are surrounded by text-production tools - from the ballpoint pen to the word processing package on our computer. Most people, if asked to produce a piece of text, could do so. This is not the case for other media like audio or video.

**Simple Formats**: Publishing text is straightforward. We can hard write text and hand it to people, print it onto paper many times, or upload it to the web where it can be read from a computer screen. We have a good understanding of the technologies that make text available to anybody who wants to read it.

**Low Barrier**: Once we have published text most of the work is already done. The person coming to the text needs to understand how to read in a particular language, but needs little other technology (eyeglasses being the exception).

**Skimmability**: Because there's such a low barrier to consumption, and because text is traditionally laid out in sections/pages we can **skim** to the most interesting passages, and restart reading quickly if we are interrupted. These seemingly trivial tasks are less straightforward in all other media.

**Interoperability**: Text is flexible enough to allow one piece of text to refer to another piece of text. Half way through a document, we can reference another source using an annotation<span class="superscript noblock">1</span> or a <a href="#">hyperlink</a>.


### The Downside to Text
**If I Had More Time I'd Write You a Shorter Letter**: Writing succinctly takes considerable practice.

**Imagination Required**: When we describe things in text we are prompting the reader to imagine those things. This can be wonderful if we're writing poetry, but isn't a great way to communicate with precision. Describing a medical device completely in text and then and asking the patient to imagine themselves using that device is unlikely to be precise enough for our purposes (in the same way that maps exist because having written directions to every place, from every place, would be annoying).

**Cognitive Load**: While the evidence related to the amount of work that reading imposes on our minds is patchy, anecdotally is seems as though reading imposes a relatively high cognitive load. Reading requires concentration, and it is difficult to do when we are tired, stressed or surrounded by distractions (particularly if we are surrounded by other people talking).

**Hands-On**: Reading text usually requires for the reader to have one or both hands free so that they can hold a book, a page or an e-reader. If it's likely that the person we're communicating with won't have their hands free then text may not be the best medium to use.

**Ubiquity/Lack of Novelty**: Because written text is ubiquitous its perceived value can be diminished. Our document that describes the side effects of Drug X might contain incredibly useful information, but if it is one of dozens and dozens of other, similar documents I might not read it. If our goal is to get people to understand Drug X and its side effects then packaging that information in a way that appears to be special and novel may help us achieve our goal in more cases.

## Audio
Audio, or more specifically recorded speech, is an effective medium to use when we need to communicate information with personality and emphasis.

### The Benefits of Using Audio
**Personal**: When we hear a recording of a person speaking, we are not actually hearing a person speaking, but it *feels* as though we are.

**The Stand-In**: Using audio allows us to record conversations between people with one or more of the participants in that conversation standing in for the listener.

For example, we could record a knowledgeable doctor speaking to an interested, but less well-informed person. The less well-informed person is a stand-in for the listener. He asks the types of questions that the listener wants to ask and clarifies points if they don't make sense or need to be emphasized. 

**Easy to Produce**: Recording and producing good quality audio can be relatively straightforward and need not be expensive. You can record on a laptop, a cell phone, an audio recorder, or in a recording studio - depending on your needs. 

When recording a conversation, staring with a well-prepared script or structure, then recording in a quiet room using the right microphone will mitigate a lot of problems that would otherwise need to be fixed in post-production.

**Hands Free**: Listening to audio doesn't require the listener to have free hands. This means that a person can carry out tasks (driving, following instructions) while listening to audio. 

### The Downsides to Audio
**Subjects**: Producing audio means finding people who are willing to speak while being recorded and who can communicate with clarity and personality. 

**Imagination Required**: One of the key strengths of audio is that it encourages the listener to imagine people and places without pictures. This is good in that it focuses the listener's attention on information, rather than the color of the subject's shirt. But, this also means that the interview subject or guide/presenter has to do a good job of describing people, objects and places. In some cases it may be a good idea to support audio with physical objects of visual aids.

**Logistics**: Recording good quality audio requires planning and preparation - identifying topics, scheduling time with subjects, developing scripts, finding a recording location, making technical arrangements etc.
