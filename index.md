A project is underway to improve patient education content provided to bone marrow transplant patients, as well as improving the way in which that content is delivered.</p>

### Project Summary
As part of the project, a **content audit** has been carried out; each piece of content relevant to BMT has been identified and categorized. Each piece of content has been converted from its current format (Word, PDF etc.) into a text file, then into a HTML web page. 

<div class="download"><a href="/bmt_contentaudit_pm2.xls"><span class="download-link"><div class="text">You can download the results of the content audit listing BMT-related patient education materials here. Download the audit, then use Excel to open the file.</div></span></a></div>

The content audit has been used to inform a **content strategy**. Each piece of content has been summarized and a number of actions have been recommended e.g. that the content should be retained in its current format, re-written, augmented with new graphics, converted into audio or video.  

As part of the content strategy each piece of content has been analyzed using a computer program to compare the language used in it to standard English - producing a list of infrequently-used words, jargon. This is the beginning of an automated approach to producing a **glossary** for each piece of content.

Building on the content audit and strategy, [a set of guidelines](/guidelines) to help Patient Education create new content for patients has been developed.

Download the tool, then use Excel to open the file.</div></span></a></div>
